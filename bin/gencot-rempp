# documentation:
# 
# We use two kinds of state which is valid over multiple lines:
# - A boolean stack for marking all nested conditional sections whether to be retained or not.
#   The current level of this stack is stored in condlevel. It is 0 on toplevel outside all
#   conditional sections, it is increased for each if/ifdef/ifndef directive and it is decreased
#   for each endif directive.
# - boolean variable remcont marking continuation lines of directives which should be removed.
#   It is set when a directive line ends with a \ and the directive shall not be retained.
#   It is cleared in the next line which does not end with a \.
#
# Implementation in awk:
# - In the BEGIN rule, if a file name is specified as argument, all lines from the file are read as 
#   regular expressions into the array regs. nregs is set to the number of regular expressions read.
#   If no argument is specified or the file cannot be read nregs is set to 0.
# - A preprocessor directive may be written with or without whitespace before and after the keyword and at
#   the beginning of the line. Every detected directive which is no line directive is first normalized 
#   by removing the whitespace around the # sign.
#   The statement $0 = $0 is used to reprocess the input line so that the keyword is in field $1.
# - We use the following regular expressions to match arbitrary directives:
#     all directives:             /^[[:blank:]]*#/
#     line directives:            /^[[:blank:]]*#[[:blank:]]*[[:digit:]]+/
# - We use the following regular expressions to match normalized directives:
#     include directives:         /^#include/
#     conditional section starts: /^#if/
#     conditional section rest:   /^#(else|elif|endif)/
#     conditional section end:    /^#endif/
#     retainable directives:      /^#(define|undef|if)/
#   The retainable directives are those which can be retained by a regular expression in regs.
# - To test whether there is a backslash at the end of the line it is matched with the regular expression /\\$/.
