# documentation:
#
# The main work is done by the C preprocessor.
# 
# To prevent it from interpreting macros all macro definitions are masked by inserting a "_" before the "#" sign.
# __VA_ARGS__ is also masked to prevent cpp from complaining that it occurs outside a macro body (which it
# does not recognise due to masking macro definitions).
