The single filters and processors of Gencot are combined for the typical use cases in the shell scripts
\code{gencot} and \code{parmod}.

\subsection{The \code{gencot} Script}
\label{impl-all-gencot}





The intended use of filter \code{gencot-remcomments} is for removing all comments from input to the language-c parser.
This input always consists of the actual source code file and the content of all included files. The simplest approach
would be to use the language-c preprocessor for it, immediately before parsing. 

However, it is easier for the filter \code{gencot-rempp} to remove the preprocessor directives when the comments are 
not present anymore. Therefore, Gencot applies the filter \code{gencot-remcomments} in a separate step before applying
\code{gencot-rempp}, immediately after processing the quoted include directives by \code{gencot-include}.
 
The filters \code{gencot-selcomments} and \code{gencot-selpp} for selecting comments and preprocessor directives, however, are
still applied to the single original source files, since they do not require additional information from the included files.




The \code{gencot} command supports the followin options:
\begin{description}
\item[\code{-I}] used to specify directories where included files are searched, like for \code{cpp}. The 
option can be repeated to specify several directories, they are searched in the order in which the options
are specified.

\item[\code{-G}]

\item[\code{-C}]

\end{description}
