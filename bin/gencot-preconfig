# This is a filter from stdin to stdout.

# documentation:
#
# A commented preprocessor directive has the form of a separate line 
#   //#...
# with arbitrary whitespace before or after the //.
# 
# Implementation in awk:
# - A commented preprocessor directive is matched by the regular expressions 
#     /^[[:blank:]]*//[[:blank:]]*#/
# - gsub replaces the matched //# by #, thus removing the comment.
