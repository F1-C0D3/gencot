# documentation:

# The macro definitions are extracted from the Cogent source by cpp.
# The option -dD has the effect that cpp outputs definitions for all macros it has read in its input
# in addition to the processed input. The option -dM would only output the macro definitions, however, they
# appear in an arbitrary order. If a definition references another macro in its body this will not be interpreted 
# as intended, if the definition of the referenced macro is moved after the definition of the referencing macro.
# To omit the normal processed input with option -dD we read the Cogent source with the option -imacros which only retains
# the information about the defined macros, as actual input /dev/null is used. Since -dD generates line directives
# we use option -P to supress them.
# All uses of the unbox operator # in the Cogent code are signaled as an error by cpp because # is expected to only mark
# preprocessor directives. The output is not affected by these errors, so they are ignored. The error messages are suppressed 
# by redirecting the error output to /dev/null.

# The result is postprocessed by an awk script for two reasons:
# - since the macro definitions origin from a Cogent source they may contain Cogent style comments, which are
#   not recognized and removed by cpp. The awk script removes these comments. Note that commented macro definitions
#   of the form
#     --#define ...
#   are not selected by cpp because it only detects directives where the # sign is the first non-whitespace character in the line.
# - cpp also adds definitions for internally defined macros. If the output is again processed by cpp it signals 
#   redefinition warnings for all macros with names starting with __STDC. The awk script removes definitions of
#   such macros.
# Additionally, the awk script removes all empty lines (lines which do not begin with #define).

# Since Cogent comments of the form {- ... -} may be nested, the variable comdepth is used to store the 
# nesting depth. Line comments starting with -- are ignored in {- ... -} and vice versa.

# Implementation in awk:
# - the variable rest is used to store the part of a line which remains to be processed.
# - the next occurrence of a comment delimiter in rest is determined with a regular expression by match(rest,/{-|-}|--/)
# - if a delimiter is found it is processed and rest is set to the remaining line after the delimiter calculated
#   by substr(rest,pos+2). In the case that a -- delimiter is found in a comment of the form {- ... -} the remaining
#   line to be processed is calculated by substr(rest,pos+1), i.e. only the first - sign is removed. This is necessary
#   to detect the closing delimiter if it is written in the form --}.
# - It is assumed that {- ... -} comments do not span multiple lines, because the macro definitions have been selected 
#   by cpp on a line-by-line basis. Therefore comdepth is initialized to 0 at the beginning of every line.
