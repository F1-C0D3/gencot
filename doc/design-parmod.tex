Gencot uses the information, whether a parameter value may be modified by a function, when it translates
the function, as described in Section~\ref{design-types-function}.

A parameter is modified, when a part of it is changed, which is referenced through a pointer. Only then the 
modification is shared with the caller and persists after the function call.

\subsection{Detecting Parameter Modifications}

A parameter may be modified by an assignment to a referenced part. Such an assignment
is easy to detect, if it directly involves the parameter name. However, the assignment can also be indirect, where
the parameter or part of it is first assigned to a local variable or another structure and then the assignment
is applied to this variable or structure. This implies that a full data flow analysis would be necessary
to detect all parameter modifications.

Gencot uses a simpler semiautomatic approach. It detects all direct parameter modifications which involve the 
parameter name automatically. It then generates a JSON description which lists all functions with their parameters
and the information about the detected modification cases. The developer has to check this description and
manually add additional cases of other parameter modifications. The resulting description is then read by
Gencot and used during translation.

Parameter modifications are only relevant if the parameter is a pointer or if a pointer can be reached by the parameter
and if at least one such pointer is not declared to have a \code{const} qualified referenced type. Gencot detects
this information from the C type and adds it to the JSON description, so that the developer can easily identify
the relevant cases where to look for modifications.

In the case of a variadic function, the number of its parameters cannot be determined from the function definition.
Here Gencot uses the invocation with the most arguments to determine the number of parameter descriptions added
to the JSON description.

A parameter may be modified by a C function locally, but it can 
also be modified by passing it or a part of it as parameter to an invoked function which modifies its corresponding
parameter. Gencot supports these dependent parameter modifications, by detecting dependencies on parameter
modifications by invoked functions and adding them to the JSON description. Again, only dependencies which
involve the parameter name are detected automatically, other dependencies must be added by the developer.

When Gencot reads the JSON template it calculates the transitive closure of all dependencies and uses it to
determine the parameter modification information. Thus the developer has only to look at every function locally,
it is not necessary to take into account the effects of invoked functions.

\subsection{Required Invocations}

To support the incremental translation of single C source files, Gencot determines the parameter modification
description for single C source files. It processes all function definitions in the file by analysing their 
function bodies. However, for an invoked function the definition may not be available, it may be defined externally
in another C source file. This situation must be handled manually: the developer has to process additional
C source files where the invoked functions are defined, to add their descriptions.

Gencot specifically selects only the relevant invocations, which are required because a parameter modification depends on it.
If a parameter is already modified locally, additional dependencies are ignored and the corresponding invocations
are not selected. In this way Gencot keeps the JSON descriptions minimal.

An invoked function may also be specified using a function pointer. In this case the possible function bodies cannot 
be determined from the program. Again, it is left to the developer to determine, whether such invocations may modify
their parameters. Gencot supports this by also adding parameter description templates for function pointers defined in the 
source file, to be filled by the developer. 

In contrast to functions, function pointers can also be defined locally in a function\footnote{The current version of
Gencot does not support C extensions for nested function definitions.} (as local variable or as parameter). Gencot
automatically adds description templates for all invoked local function pointers.

\subsection{External Invocations}

Finally, a required invocation may be external to the package which is processed by Gencot, such as an invocation of
a function in the C standard library. When all remaining required invocations are external in this sense, Gencot
can be told to ``close'' the JSON description. Then it uses the declarations of all required invocations to generate
a description template for each of them. Since no bodies are available, the developer must fill in the information
for all these external functions (and function pointers).

Invoked function pointers may also be members of a struct or union type. For them no definition exists, they are also 
handled by Gencot when closing a JSON description: for all required invocations of a struct or union member a 
description template is added which is identified by the member name and the tag of the struct or union type. Invocations
of function pointer members in anonymous struct or union types are ignored by the current Gencot version.
