Gencot
======

Gencot is a tool for partially translating C code to Cogent.

This is incomplete work in progress in alpha state. Use with care.

Prerequisites
-------------

Gencot assumes a Unix environment and the Haskell platform. It consists of a collection of Haskell programs and (Bourne) shell scripts which use standard Unix commands such as awk, sed, and others.

For installation you need the Haskell compiler and the Cabal build system.

Installation
------------

1. In a directory `G` clone this project (Gencot).
    This will yield `G/gencot`
2. In `G/gencot` execute

        make
3. Set environment variable `GENCOT_HOME` to `G/gencot`, e.g., by

        export GENCOT_HOME=G/gencot

Now you can use the commands

    gencot,parmod,auxcog
which are located in `G/gencot/bin` (by adding this directory to the command search path or by specifying the path when the command is invoked).

Introduction
------------

Read the Gencot manual [manual/gencot-manual.pdf](manual/gencot-manual.pdf) (for easy access it is provided as a PDF file). 
It uses and explains the examples in subdirectory [examples](examples).

The concept and implementation is documented in [doc/gencot-devel.pdf](doc/gencot-devel.pdf).
