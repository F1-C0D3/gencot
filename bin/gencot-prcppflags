# documentation:
# 
# A preprocessor flag definition has the form
#   #define NNN
# where NNN is only followed by optional whitespace and a newline.
# Definitions where NNN is listed in the argument file are omitted.
#
# Implementation in awk:
# - After matching a normalized include directive, NNN is field 2.
# - To test whether field 2 contains a parenthesis it is matched against the pattern /\(/.
# - To test whether NNN is not followed by a replacement text or a backslash (for a continuation line)
#   the number of fields NF is tested to be 2.
