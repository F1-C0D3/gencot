Gencot supports basic operations either by providing a Cogent implementation, or by providing
a C implementation for functions defined as abstract in Cogent.

are used in a program 
this is not detected as error by the Cogent compiler. However, since Gencot does not provide implementations for such
instances the resulting C program will not compile.

\subsubsection{Creating and Disposing Arrays}

The \code{create} instance is implemented by simply allocating the
required space on the heap, internally using the translation of type \code{\#A<size>\_El} to specify
the amount of space.
