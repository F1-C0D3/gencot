\subsection{Cogent Source File Structure}
\label{design-files}

Although the Cogent source is not structured on the level of compilation units, Gencot intends to reflect the structure of 
the C program at the level of Cogent source files. 

Note, that there are four kinds of include statements available in Cogent source files. One is the \code{include} statement which
is part of the Cogent language. When it is used to include the same file several times in the same Cogent compilation unit,
the file content is automatically inserted only once. However, the Cogent preprocessor is executed separately for every file included 
with this \code{include} statement, thus preprocessor macros defined in an included file are not available in all other files. For 
this reason it cannot be used to reflect the file structure of a C program.

The second kind is the Cogent preprocessor \code{\#include} directive, it works like the C preprocessor \code{\#include} directive
and is used by Gencot to integrate the separate Cogent source files. 
The third kind is the preprocessor \code{\#include} directive 
which can be used in antiquoted C files where the Cogent \code{include} statement is not available. This is only possible 
if the included content is also an antiquoted C file. The fourth kind
is the \code{\#include} directive of the C preprocessor which can be used in antiquoted C files in the form 
\code{\$esc:(\#include ...)}. It is only executed when the C code generated by the Cogent compiler is processed by the C compiler.
Hence it can be used to include normal C code.

Gencot assumes the usual C source structure: Every \code{.c} file contains definitions with internal or external linkage.
Every \code{.h}
file contains preprocessor constant definitions, type definitions and function declarations. The constants and type definitions 
are usually mainly those which are needed for the function declarations. Every \code{.c} file includes the \code{.h} file which
declares the functions which are defined by the \code{.c} file to access the constants and type definitions. Additionally it may
include other \code{.h} files to be able to invoke the functions declared there. A \code{.h} file may include other \code{.h} files
to reuse their constants and type definitions in its own definitions and declarations.

\subsubsection{Cogent Source Files}

In Cogent a function which is defined may not be declared as an abstract function elsewhere in the program. If the types and constants,
needed for defining a set of functions, should be moved to a separate file, like in C, this file must not contain the 
function declarations for the defined functions. Declarations for functions defined in Cogent are not needed at all, since the Cogent 
source is a single compilation unit and functions can be invoked at any place in a Cogent program, independently whether their definition 
is statically before or after this place.

Therefore we map every C source file \code{x.c} to a Cogent source file \code{x.cogent} containing definitions of the same 
functions. We map every C include file \code{x.h} to a Cogent source file \code{x-incl.cogent} 
containing the corresponding constant and type definitions, but omitting any function declarations. The include relations among 
\code{.c} and \code{.h} files are directly transferred to \code{.cogent} and \code{-incl.cogent} using the Cogent preprocessor 
\code{\#include} directive. 

The file \code{x-incl.cogent} also contains Cogent value definitions generated from C preprocessor
constant definitions and from enumeration constants (see below). It would be possible to put the value definitions in a 
separate file. However, then for other preprocessor macro definitions it would not be clear where to put them, since they could
be used both in constant and type definitions. They cannot be moved to a common file included by both at the beginning,
since their position relative to the places where the macros are used is relevant.

In some cases an \code{x.h} file contains function definitions, typically for inlined functions. They are translated to Cogent
function defintions in the \code{x-incl.cogent} file in the usual way.

This file mapping implies that for every translated \code{.c} file all directly or indirectly included \code{.h} files must be 
translated as well.

\subsubsection{Wrapper Definition Files}

The entry wrappers for the functions defined with external linkage in \code{x.c} are implemented in antiquoted C code and
put in the file \code{x-entry.ac}. 

The exit wrappers for invoking C functions from Cogent are only created for the actual
external references in a processing step for the whole <package>. They are implemented in antiquoted C
and put in the file \code{<package>-externs.ac}.

\subsubsection{External Name References}

For external name references Gencot generates the information required for Cogent. 
All generated type and constant definitions are put in the file \code{<package>-exttypes.cogent}.

If a Cogent function in \code{x.cogent} invokes a function which is externally referenced and not defined in another
file \code{y.cogent}, this function must be declared as an abstract function in Cogent. These abstract function declarations
are only created for the actual
external references in a processing step for the whole <package>. They are put in the file \code{<package>-externs.cogent}.
The corresponding exit wrappers are put in file \code{<package>-externs.ac} as described above.

For external variables Gencot creates declarations in antiquoted C. Since they are only accessed in 
the entry wrapper functions they are put into the files \code{x-entry.ac} at the beginning before the entry wrapper 
definitions. For all
external variables which are used by a function defined in \code{x.c} and must be passed as argument to the 
translated function a declaration is generated in \code{x-entry.c}.

\subsubsection{Derived Types}

Gencot generates definitions of unary abstract generic type definitions for derived array types 
used in the C source. It also generates definitions of abstract data types for derived function types 
used in the C source. All these definitions are put in the file \code {<package>-dvdtypes.cogent}.

Corresponding type implementations in antiquoted C are generated by Gencot in the file \code{<package>-dvdtypes.ah}.

\subsubsection{Global Variables}

In C a compilation unit may define global variables. Gencot does not generate a direct access interface to these variables
from Cogent code. However, the variables must still be present in a compilation unit, since they may be accessed
from other C compilation units (if they have external linkage). 

Gencot assumes that global variables are only defined in \code{.c} files. For every file \code{x.c} Gencot generates
antiquoted C definitions for all global variables (toplevel object) defined in \code{x.c}. If the variable has 
external linkage the definition uses the original name, thus it can be accessed from outside the Cogent compilation unit. 
If the variable has internal linkage the definition uses the mapped name so that it is unique in the Cogent compilation
unit. 

In the Cogent compilation unit the defined global variables are only accessed in 
the entry wrapper functions. Therefore Gencot puts them into the files \code{x-entry.ac} at the places where 
their definition occurred in the original source. Additionally they are declared at the beginning of the file, 
so that they can be accessed in entry wrappers defined before that position.

\subsubsection{Predefined Gencot Types and Functions}

Gencot provides several Cogent types and functions which are used to translate C types and operators for them
(see Sections~\ref{design-types} and~\ref{design-operations}. Cogent definitions for all these types and functions 
are provided in files which are part of the Gencot distribution and are contained in a directory \code{include/gencot}.
When Cogent is used to process a source generated by Gencot the directory \code{include} must be made known to the 
Cogent preprocessor using the compiler option \code{--cogent-pp-args}. Then the files can be included in the Cogent
source in the form
\begin{verbatim}
  #include "gencot/xxx.cogent"
\end{verbatim}

Some of the types and functions are abstract, the corresponding definitions in antiquoted C are provided in single
files \code{gencot.ah} and \code{gencot.ac} in the Gencot distribution. These files must be processed by the Cogent 
compiler using the options \code{--infer-c-types} and \code{--infer-c-funcs}, respectively, to generate the C source 
as part of the Cogent compilation unit. For generic abstract types the Cogent compiler generates a C source file
for every instance used in the Cogent program, these files are generated in the subdirectory \code{abstract} of the
directory where the Cogent compilation unit is compiled. The file \code{gencot.ac} is compiled to a single file 
\code{gencot\_pp\_inferred.c}. Since nearly all predefined Gencot functions are polymorphic the file \code{gencot.ac}
is used as a template and only the C source code for those function instances are generated in \code{gencot\_pp\_inferred.c}
which are actually used in the Cogent program.

\subsubsection{Abstract Data Types}

There may also be cases of C types where no corresponding Cogent type can be defined or is predefined be Gencot.
In this case it must be manually mapped to an 
abstract data type T in Cogent, consisting of an abstract type together with abstract functions. Both are put in 
a file \code{T.cogent} which must be included manually by all \code{x-incl.cogent} where it is used. The types and 
functions of T must be implemented in additional C code. In contrast to the abstract functions defined in 
\code{<package>-externs.cogent},
there are no existing C files where these functions are implemented. The implementations are provided as antiquoted C
code in the file \code{T.ac}. If T is generic, the additional file \code{T.ah} is required for 
implementing the types, otherwise they are implemented in \code{T.h}. In this case \code{T.h} must be \code{\$esc}-included
in \code{T.ac} so that it is included in the final C source of the Cogent compilation unit.

Gencot does not provide any support for using abstract data types, they must be managed manually according to the following
proposed schema. An abstract data type T is implemented in the following files:
\begin{description}
\item[\code{T.ac}] Antiquoted Cogent definitions of all functions of T. 
\item[\code{T.ah}] Antiquoted Cogent definition for T if T is generic.
\item[\code{T.h}] Antiquoted Cogent definitions of all non-generic types of T.
\end{description}
Using the flag \code{--infer-c-types} the Cogent compiler generates from \code{T.ah} files \code{T\_t1...tn.h} for all 
instantiations of T with type arguments t1...tn used in the Cogent code.

\subsubsection{File Summary}

Summarizing, Gencot uses the following kinds of Cogent source files for existing C source files \code{x.c} and \code{x.h}:
\begin{description}
\item[\code{x.cogent}] Implementation of all functions defined in \code{x.c}. For each file \code{y.h} included by
  \code{x.c} the file \code{y-incl.cogent} is included.
\item[\code{x-incl.cogent}] Constant and type definitions for all constants and types defined in \code{x.h}. 
  If possible, for every C type definition a binary compatible Cogent type 
  definition is generated by Gencot. Otherwise an abstract type definition is used. Includes
  all \code{y-incl.cogent} for which \code{x.h} includes \code{y.h}.
\item[\code{x-entry.ac}] Antiquoted Cogent definitions of entry wrapper functions for all function definitions with external linkage
  defined in \code{x.c}. Declarations of all external global variables used in the entry wrappers, and definitions
  of all global variables defined in \code{x.c}
\end{description}

For the Cogent compilation unit the following common files are used:
\begin{description}
\item[\code{<package>-exttypes.cogent}] Type and constant definitions for all external type and constant references.
\item[\code{<package>-externs.cogent}] Abstract function definitions for all external function and variable references.
\item[\code{<package>-dvdtypes.cogent}] Abstract generic type definitions for all used derived array and function pointer types.
\item[\code{<package>-externs.ac}] Exit wrapper definitions for all external function references.
\item[\code{<package>-dvdtypes.ah}] Implementations of abstract generic types defined in \code{<package>-dvdtypes.cogent}.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Main Files}

To put everything together we use the files \code{<package>.cogent} and \code{<package>.c}. The former includes all 
existing \code{x.cogent} files and the files \code{<package>-exttypes.cogent}, \code{<package>-externs.cogent}, 
\code{<package>-dvdtypes.cogent}, and all required files \code{gencot/Xxx.cogent} for predefined types and functions.
It is the file processed by the Cogent compiler which translates it to files \code{<package>-gen.c} 
and \code{<package>-gen.h} where \code{<package>-gen.c} includes \code{<package>-gen.h} and \code{<package>-gen.h} includes all files
in subdirectory \code{abstract} which have been generated from \code{gencot.ah}, \code{<package>-dvdtypes.ah}, and any
other file \code{T.ah} for manually implemented abstract data types. 

Cogent also compiles all files \code{x-entry.ac}, \code{T.ac}, \code{<package>-externs.ac}, and \code{gencot.ac} to corresponding 
files \code{x-entry\_pp\_inferred.c}, \code{T\_pp\_inferred.c}, \code{<package>-externs\_pp\_inferred.c}, and \code{gencot\_pp\_inferred.c}, respectively.

The file \code{<package>.c} includes all existing files 
\code{x-entry\_pp\_inferred.c}, \code{T\_pp\_inferred.c}, \code{<package>-externs\_pp\_inferred.c}, \code{gencot\_pp\_inferred.c}, 
together with \code{<package>-gen.c} and constitutes the C code of the Cogent compilation unit. It is the file to be compiled 
by the C compiler to produce the executable program and to be read by the Isabelle C parser when checking the refinement proof.
