Here we define rules how to map common C types to binary compatible Cogent types. Since the usefulness of a mapping
also depends on the way how values of the type are processed in the C program, the resulting types may require manual 
modification.

\subsection{Numerical Types}
\label{design-types-prim}

The Cogent primitive types are mapped to C types in \code{cogent/lib/cogent-defns.h} which is included by the Cogent compiler
in every generated C file with \code{\#include <cogent-defns.h>}. The mappings are: 
\begin{verbatim}
  U8 -> unsigned char
  U16 -> unsigned short 
  U32 -> unsigned int
  U64 -> unsigned long long
  Bool -> struct bool_t { unsigned char boolean }
  String -> char*
\end{verbatim}
The inverse mapping can directly be used for the unsigned C types. For the corresponding signed C types to be binary
compatible, the same mapping is used. Differences only occur when negative values are actually used, this must be handled by using specific functions for numerical operations in Cogent.

In C all primitive types are numeric and are mapped by Gencot to a primitive type in Cogent. Note that in C the representation 
of numeric types may depend on the C version and target system architecture. However, the main goal of Gencot is only to generate
Cogent types which are, after translation to C, binary compatible with the original C types. Hence it is sufficient for the numerical 
types to simply invert the Mapping used by the Cogent compiler.

Together we have the following mappings:
\begin{verbatim}
char, unsigned/signed char -> U8
short, unsigned/signed short -> U16
int, unsigned/signed int -> U32
long int, unsigned/signed long int -> U64
long long int, unsigned/signed long long int -> U64
\end{verbatim}

The only mapping not determined by the Cogent compiler mapping is that for \code{long int}. For the gcc C version 
it depends on the architecture and is either the same as \code{int} (on 32 bit systems) or \code{long long int}
(on 64 bit systems). Gencot assumes a 64 bit system and maps it like \code{long long int}.

\subsection{Enumeration Types}
\label{design-types-enum}

A C enumeration type of the form \code{enum e} is a subset of type \code{int} and declares enumeration 
constants which have type \code{int}. According to the C99 standard, an enumeration type may be implemented
by type \code{char} or any integer type large enough to hold all its enumeration constants.

A natural mapping for C enumeration types would be Cogent variant types. However, the C implementation
of a Cogent variant type is never binary compatible with an integer type (see below). 

Therefore C enumeration types must be mapped to a primitive integer type in Cogent. Depending on the C
implementation, this may always be type \code{U32} or it may depend on the value of the last enumeration
constant and be either \code{U8}, \code{U16}, \code{U32}, or maybe even \code{U64}. Under Linux, both cc
and gcc always use type \code{int}, independent of the value of the last enumeration constant. 
Therefore Gencot always maps enumeration types to Cogent type \code{U32}.

If an enumeration type has a tag, Gencot preserves the tag information for the programmer and uses
a type name of the form \code{Enum\_tag}, as described in Section~\ref{design-names}. For tagless enums
no type names are introduced, they are directly mapped to type \code{U32}.

The rules for mapping enumeration types are
\begin{verbatim}
  enum { ... } -> U32
  enum e { ... } -> Enum_e
  enum e -> Enum_e
\end{verbatim}

The enumeration constants must be mapped to Cogent constant definitions of the corresponding type. In 
C the value for an enumeration constant may be explicitly specified, this can easily be mapped to
the Cogent constant definitions.

An enumeration declaration of the form \code{enum e \{C1, C2, C3=5, C4\}} is translated as
\begin{verbatim}
  cogent_C1: U32
  cogent_C1 = 0
  cogent_C2: U32
  cogent_C2 = 1
  cogent_C3: U32
  cogent_C3 = 5
  cogent_C4: U32
  cogent_C4 = 6
\end{verbatim}
Note that the C constant names are mapped to Cogent names as described in Section~\ref{design-names}.

\subsection{Structure and Union Types}
\label{design-types-struct}

A C structure type of the form \code{struct \{ ... \}} is equivalent to a Cogent unboxed record type \code{\#\{ ... \}}.
The Cogent compiler translates the unboxed record type to the C struct and maps all fields in the same order.
If every C field type is mapped to a binary compatible Cogent field type both types are binary compatible as a whole.

*** This is not true! Record fields are reordered by the Cogent compiler. Dargent must be used to get binary compatible types.

\subsubsection{Mapping Struct and Union Types}
A C structure may contain bit-fields where the number of bits used for storing the field is explicitly specified.
Gencot maps every consecutive sequence of bit-fields to a single Cogent field with a primitive Cogent type.
The Cogent type is determined by the sum of the bits of the bit-fields in the sequence. It is the smallest 
type chosen from \code{U8, U16, U32, U64} which is large enough to hold this number of bits. 
***--> test whether this is correct.
The name of the
Cogent field is \code{cogent\_bitfield}<n> where <n> is the number of the bit-field sequence in the C structure.
Gencot does not generate Cogent code for accessing the single bit-fields. If needed this must be done manually in Cogent.
However, Gencot adds comments after the Cogent bitfield showing the original C bit-field declarations.

A C union type of the form \code{union \{ ... \}} is not binary compatible to any type generated by the Cogent compiler.
The semantic equivalent would be a Cogent variant type. However, the Cogent compiler translates every variant type
to a \code{struct} with a field for an \code{enum} covering the variants, and one field for every variant. Even if a variant
is empty (has no additional fields), in the C \code{struct} it is present with type \code{unit\_t} which
has the size of an \code{int}. Therefore Gencot maps every union type to an unboxed abstract Cogent type.

Another semantic equivalent would be a Cogent record type, where always all fields but one are taken. However,
this type is not binary compatible either, it is translated to a normal struct where every member has another
offset. Even if the translated type in C is manually changed to a union, the Cogent take and put operations cannot
be used since they respect the field offsets. 

Together we have the mapping rules:
\begin{verbatim}
  struct s -> #Struct_s
  union s -> #Union_s
\end{verbatim}
where \code{Struct\_s} is the Cogent name of a record type corresponding to \code{struct s} and \code{Union\_s} is the
name of the abstract type introduced for \code{union s}.

As explained in Section~\ref{design-names}, Gencot always introduces a Cogent type name for each struct and union,
even if no tag is present in C. Since the tag name is either defined to name a Cogent record or an abstract type,
it is always linear and names a boxed type which corresponds to a pointer. Hence, the type name generated for a struct
is always used to refer to the type ``pointer to struct'', the struct type itself is translated to the type name 
with the unbox operator applied. The same holds for union types.

\subsection{Array Types}
\label{design-types-array}

A C array type \code{t[n]} has the semantics of a consecutive sequence of n instances of type \code{t}. A value
of type \code{t[n]} is a pointer to the first element and therefore compatible to type \code{t*}.

Basically, Cogent does not support accessing elements by an index value in an array. 
This is an important security feature since the index value is computed at runtime and cannot be statically 
compared to the array length by the compiler. Therefore, a C array type can only be mapped to an abstract type 
in Cogent, which prevents accessing its elements in Cogent code. Element access must be implemented externally 
with the help of abstract functions.

The Cogent standard library includes three abstract data types for arrays (\code{Wordarray, Array, UArray}). 
However, they cannot be used as a binary compatible replacement for C arrays, because they are implemented by 
pointers to a \code{struct} containing the array length together with the pointer to the array elements. 
Only if the C array pointer is contained in such a struct, it is possible to use the abstract data types. 
In existing C code the array length is often present somewhere at runtime, but not in a single \code{struct}
directly before the array pointer.

As of December 2018 there is an experimental Cogent array type written \code{T[n]}. It is binary compatible 
with the C array type \code{t[n]}. It is not linear, however it only supports read access to the array elements, 
the element values cannot be replaced. Thus it can be used as replacement for a pure abstract type, if the array 
is never modified and if it does not contain any pointers (directly or indirectly). If it is modified, replacing
elements can be implemented externally with the help of abstract functions.

In C the incomplete type \code{t[]} can be used in certain places. It may be completed statically, e.g. 
when initialized. Then the number of elements is statically known and the type can be mapped like \code{t[n]}.
If the number of elements is not statically known the type cannot be mapped to a Cogent array, it must be mapped 
to an abstract type.

Since the Cogent array type is still under development, the current version of Gencot does not use it for
mapping C array types. Instead, all C array types are mapped to Cogent with the help of generated names for 
abstract types.

As a C derived type, every array type depends on its base type, which is the element type. It must be defined in
the C source before the array type can be used. The Cogent compiler can only respect this ordering requirement if
it knows that the abstract type to which the array type is mapped depends on the type to which the element type
is mapped. The only way to make this known to the Cogent compiler is to use a generic type for the array with
a single type parameter for the element type. 

When a C array type is used for a field in a record, after translation from Cogent to C a type
must be used which includes the array size. To be able to specify a corresponding C typedef for the 
Cogent abstract type name, array types with different size specifications must be mapped to different 
Cogent abstract type names. This is the reason why the size specification is encoded into the type name,
as described in Section~\ref{design-names}. So a different type name is required for every array size 
occurring in the C program.

\subsubsection{Mapping Array Types}

A C array type \code{t[n]} has two slightly different meanings. When it is used for allocating space in memory,
it is used to determine the required space as \code{n * sizeof(t)}. When it is used as declared type for an 
identifier, it means that the identifier names a (constant) value of type \code{t*}, since C arrays are 
always represented by a pointer to the first element. In Cogent both cases must be supported. However, since 
the first case corresponds to a nonlinear (unboxed) type and the second case corresponds to a linear type, 
different Cogent types must be used. If the types are directly implemented by \code{t*} and \code{t[n]}, the 
linear type is not the derived pointer type of the nonlinear type, then the difference cannot be implemented 
by using a single type name with the unbox operator applied or not.

If the nonlinear case is implemented as a struct with the array as its only member, the
linear case can be implemented by a pointer to this struct which corresponds in Cogent to the same type
with the unbox operator omitted. The pointer to the struct is binary compatible with the pointer to its
only member which is binary compatible with the pointer to the first array element. 
This solution depends on the property, that a C struct with a single array as member has the same memory
layout as the array itself. If the C implementation adds padding after the array (it
cannot add it before the array according to the C specification), another solution must be used.

Together, this way the C array type is mapped for literal size specifications using a single generic abstract Cogent type
\begin{verbatim}
  type UArr<size> el
\end{verbatim}
whith an antiquoted C type definition 
\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct $id:(UArr<size> el) {
	$ty:el arr[<size>];
} $id:(UArr<size> el);
\end{verbatim}

As described in Section~\ref{design-operations-create} Gencot provides for every mapped linear type a separate type
for ``empty'' values. For a record type \code{R} the type \code{R take (..)} is used. However, the 
\code{take} operator can normally not be applied to an abstract type. There are three possible approaches for mapped 
array types.

The first approach uses the Cogent compiler flag \code{--flax-take-put} which allows the \code{take} operator to
be applied to abstract types (including abstract generic types). However, as of October 2019 the Cogent type checker 
is instable for such types and cannot process all applications. Therefore this approach is not used by Gencot.

The second approach uses a wrapper struct also in Cogent:
\begin{verbatim}
  type CArr<size> el = {arr: #(UArr<size> el)}
  type UArr<size> el
\end{verbatim}
This makes it possible to use the Cogent take type operator for modelling empty-value array types.
The drawback is that two different Cogent type names are required and that arrays are wrapped twice as struct.

The double wrapping could be avoided if type \code{UArr<size>} is directly implemented by the array type
in C as in
\begin{verbatim}
  typedef $ty:el $id:(UArr<size> el)[<size>];
\end{verbatim}
However, there are two problems with this approach. First, the Cogent compiler does not support antiquoted
type definitions for generating this form (the type parameter \code{\$ty:el} is only known in a struct type
with the generic type as tag name). Second, Cogent translates take and put operations for a record field 
to an assignment in C. Therefore, if field \code{arr} in a value of type \code{CArr<size> El} is put or taken, 
the C code generated by Cogent will be wrong, since arrays cannot be assigned in C. 

The third approach uses a second generic abstract type 
\begin{verbatim}
  type UEArr<size> el
\end{verbatim}
for every \code{<size>} to represent the empty-value array type. It is defined in C in the same way as type \code{UArr<size>}.
This also avoids the double wrapping. It does not use the \code{take} operator to construct the empty-value type
for array types, so there is no relation between both which is known to Cogent. However, the only situation where this
relation would be useful is for type variables, but the \code{take} operator cannot be applied to type variables since
it is not possible in Cogent to restrict a type variable to record types. 

The drawback of the third approach is that the empty-value 
type is constructed in different ways for mapped arrays and for mapped structs. This makes it impossible to define 
a single common macro \code{EVT} for this type construction in Section~\ref{design-operations-create}. This further 
implies that no single macro is possible if it uses \code{EVT}, and, in particular, since the type for pointers to
an unboxed array is the boxed array type (see Section~\ref{design-types-pointer}) this case must be distinguished 
in Macros which apply \code{EVT} to a constructed pointer type.

Therefore the decision in Gencot is to use the second approach. For every array \code{<size>} used in the C 
program the two generic Cogent types \code{CArr<size>} and \code{UArr<size>} are used where the latter is
abstract and is defined in antiquoted C as described above.

For constructing an array type from a given size and element type Gencot provides the preprocessor macro
\begin{verbatim}
  CARR(<size>,<ek>,el)
\end{verbatim}
defined in \code{include/gencot/CArray.cogent}. The parameter \code{<ek>} can be used to specify an unbox
operator for the element type, it may be \code{U} or empty. The form \code{CARR(<size>,U,el)} is equivalent
to \code{CARR(<size>,,\#el)}. The main reason for this parameter is compatibility to the macro \code{CPTR}
defined in Section~\ref{design-types-pointer}, so that it is possible to construct an array type and the 
pointer-to-element type from the same input. Both macros are mainly intended to be used for defining other
macros.

The unboxed type \code{\#(Carr<size> El)} is binary compatible with the C array type and can be used for
the nonlinear case. It is a usual Cogent unboxed record and can be used freely. 
If another Cogent record has a field of an unboxed array type, the take and put operations can be applied
in the usual way, assigning the array content as a whole.

As described in Section~\ref{design-names} the form \code{CArrX<size>X}
is used if the size is specified by an identifier and the single predefined generic type \code{CArrXX} is used for all other
size specifications and for array types without size specification. In the latter case no antiquoted C type definition
for the corresponding type \code{UArrXX} is provided by Gencot, C type definitions for instances must be provided 
manually. The types \code{CArrXX} and \code{UArrXX} are defined in \code{include/gencot/CArray.cogent}.

If the element type \code{El} is again an array type, the meaning in C is a multidimensional array.
This case is mapped to Cogent in the straightforward way, using an unboxed inner array type as element type
for the outer array type. For example, the C type \code{int[2][7]} is mapped to the Cogent type
\begin{verbatim}
  CArr2 #(CArr7 U32)
\end{verbatim}
which in C is a doubly wrapped array of doubly wrapped elements which should nevertheless be binary compatible 
to \code{int[2][7]}. Using the macro \code{CARR} it can be specified as \code{CARR(2,U,CARR(7,,U32))}.

Whether a C array type is mapped to the boxed or unboxed form depends on its usage context.
A C array type cannot be used as result type of a function. Thus, the remaining possible uses of a C array type are
\begin{itemize}
\item as type of a global variable. This is translated using an access function which returns the variable
value as a pointer of the boxed type \code{CArr<size> El}.
\item as type of a function parameter. In C this is ``adjusted'' to the pointer-to-element type. Since this
is binary compatible with type \code{CArr<size> El}, this type is used as parameter type in Cogent. Alternatively 
the adjusted type could be mapped, resulting in type \code{CPtr El} or \code{El} (in case of elements of unboxed 
record or array type). The type \code{CArr<size> El} is preferred here by Gencot since it preserves more information.
\item as type of a member in a struct type. Here the size of the array is relevant, therefore the unboxed type
\code{\#(CArr<size> El)} is used as type for the corresponding Cogent record field.
\item as element type of another array, resulting in a multidimensional array. Again the size of the array 
is relevant here, the unboxed type \code{\#(CArr<size> El)} is used as element type.
\item as base type of a derived pointer type. Here the binary compatible type is the boxed type \code{CArr<size> El}
since it corresponds to a pointer to the array.
\item as defining type for a typedef name. Here the type to be used depends on the context where the typedef
name is used. As described in Section~\ref{design-types-typedef}, Gencot defines the mapped 
typedef name always as an alias for the boxed type \code{CArr<size> El}. Then applying the unbox operator to the typedef name 
is equivalent to applying it to \code{CArr<size> El}.
\end{itemize}

Together we have the following mapping rules for C arrays with element type \code{el} and size 
specification \code{<size>}. Depending on the context of the C array type, additionally the unbox operator must be applied.
\begin{verbatim}
  el[<literal size>] -> CArr<literal size> El
  el[<size id>] -> CArrX<size id>X El
  el[<complex size>] -> CArrXX El
  el[] -> CArrXX El
  el[*] -> CArrXX El
\end{verbatim}
where El is the result of mapping the element type \code{el} to a Cogent type. If the size specification
is too complex (not a literal or single identifier) it is omitted and the type must be handled manually.

\subsection{Function Types}
\label{design-types-function}

C function types of the form \code{t (...)} are used in C only for declaring or defining functions or
when a typedef name is defined for a function type. In all other
places they are either not allowed or automatically adjusted to the corresponding function pointer type
of the form \code{t (*)(...)}. 

\subsubsection{Mapping Function Parameters}

In Cogent every function
has only one parameter. To be mapped to Cogent, the parameters of a C function with more than one parameter must
be aggregated in a tuple or in a record. A C function type \code{t (void)} which has no parameters is mapped
to the Cogent function type \code{() -> T} with a parameter of unit type.

The difference between using a tuple or record for the function parameters is that the fields in a 
record are named, in a tuple they are not. In 
a C function definition the parameters may be omitted, otherwise they are specified with names in a prototype.
In C function types the names of some or all parameters may be omitted, specifying only the parameter type.

It would be tempting to map C function types to Cogent functions with a record as parameter, whenever parameter 
names are available in C, and use a tuple as parameter otherwise. However, in C it is possible to assign a 
pointer to a function which has been defined 
with parameter names to a variable where the type does not provide parameter names such as in 
\begin{verbatim}
  int add (int x, int y) {...}
  int (*fun)(int,int);
  fun = &add;
\end{verbatim}
This case would result in Cogent code with incompatible function types.

For this reason we always use a tuple as parameter type in Cogent. Cogent tuple types are equivalent, if they
have the same number of fields in the same order and the fields have equivalent types. To preserve the C parameter names in 
a function definition, the parameter is matched with a tuple pattern containing variables of these
names as fields.

C function types where a variable number of
parameters is specified such as in \code{t (...)} (``variadic function type'') must 
be treated manually in specific ways. Gencot maps variadic function types
with an additional last parameter type \code{VariadicCogentParameters}. This pseudo type is intended 
to inform the developer that manual action is required. The bang operator is applied as a hint
that no modifications are returned. For a function pointer, the corresponding Cogent type has
the form \code{\#(CFun ((...,VariadicCogentParameters!) -> <result type>))}.

C function types where the parameters are omitted, such as in \code{t ()} (``incomplete function type'') 
cannot be mapped to a Cogent function type in this way. 
They can only be mapped using an abstract type as parameter type. This can again lead to incompatible 
Cogent types if a function pointer is assigned where parameters have been specified, these cases must 
be treated manually in specific ways. Note that incomplete function types cannot be used for function
definitions, only for function pointers and for declarations of external functions. 
Gencot does not translate declarations of functions with incomplete types, these must be added manually.
This behavior of Gencot is also exploited to handle manually translated macros, as described in 
Section~\ref{impl-ccomps-externs}.

Together the rules for mapping function types are
\begin{verbatim}
  t(t1, ..., tn) -> (T1, ..., Tn) -> T
  t(void) -> () -> T
  t(t1,...,tn,...) -> (T1, ..., Tn, Variadic_Cogent_Parameters!) -> T
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Linear and Readonly Parameter Types}

Like every other type, the type of a function parameter may be readonly because this property can be derived
from the C type information, as described in Section~\ref{design-types-readonly}. However, in a C program 
often a parameter is actually never modified, although this property cannot be derived from the C type information.
Since this is an important property for working with linear types in Cogent, Gencot tries to capture these
cases as well and make the parameter type readonly.

For a parameter with linear type, the function can only be defined in Cogent if the parameter is not discarded,
i.e. it must be part of the result. Gencot assumes the most simple handling of this case, where the result
is a tuple consisting of the original result of the C function together with a component for every parameter
of linear type. To avoid these extra result components, Gencot tries to make all parameters with linear type
readonly and add only the remaining parameters to the result type.

A parameter of linear type may not be discarded in Cogent, but it may be passed to an abstract function which discards
it. In this case the parameter must not be returned, although it does not have readonly type.

Gencot determines the information about parameter modification and parameter discarding in a semi-automatic way
as described in Section~\ref{design-parmod}. It uses this information to make parameter types readonly or
add parameters to the function result, according to the following rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the C type of a parameter is not linear according to Section~\ref{design-types-readonly}, or if it
is discarded according to Section~\ref{design-parmod}, it is translated as described before.
\item Otherwise, if the C type of the parameter is readonly according to Section~\ref{design-types-readonly}, or
is not modified according to Section~\ref{design-parmod} its translated type is made readonly by applying the
bang operator \code{!}. For a single such parameter of type \code{r} the translation rule becomes
\begin{verbatim}
  t(t1, ... r, ... tn) -> (T1, ... R!, ... Tn) -> T
\end{verbatim}
\item Otherwise, if the parameter is already returned as result of the function, it is translated as described before.
\item Otherwise, the function result is changed to a tuple and the parameter is added as component to that tuple.
For a single such parameter of type \code{l} the translation rule becomes
\begin{verbatim}
  t(t1, ... l, ... tn) -> (T1, ... L, ... Tn) -> (T,L)
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

If the result is modified to a tuple, the first component is the original function result and the remaining components
are the parameters of linear type in their order as they occur in the parameter tuple.

\subsection{Pointer Types}
\label{design-types-pointer}

In general, a C pointer type \code{t*} is the kind of types targeted by Cogent linear types. The linear type 
allows the Cogent compiler to statically guarantee that pointer values will neither be duplicated nor 
discarded by Cogent code, it will always be passed through. 

If a pointer points to a C \code{struct} there is additional support for field access available in Cogent by 
mapping the pointer to a Cogent boxed record type. For all other pointer types this support can be employed by
mapping the type to a Cogent record with a single field of the type referenced by the pointer.

In C, a pointer-to-array type is not the type of pointers to the array address, instead its values are array addresses.
The difference from the array type is only that when applying the index operator \code{[]}, the whole array is
selected instead of only the first element. In Cogent the corresponding type is a Cogent record with a single
field of the unboxed mapped array type. Note, that this is equivalent to the mapping of the array type itself, as defined
in Section~\ref{design-types-array}, so it is used by Gencot.

As described for array types in Section~\ref{design-types-array}, Cogent must know that a pointer type depends on 
its base type, which is the type of the referenced value. Therefore pointer types are mapped to generic types which
have the base type as single type parameter. Since there is no additional information to be encoded for a pointer
type other than its base type, a single generic type is sufficient for all pointer types. As described in 
Section~\ref{design-names} the type name \code{CPtr} is used for this purpose.

\subsubsection{Mapping Pointer Types}

A pointer type \code{t*} to a struct is mapped to the corresponding boxed type, 
that means, it is mapped like the struct type \code{t}, but the unbox operator is omitted.

A pointer type \code{t*} where \code{t} is a union type is mapped in the same way to the corresponding
boxed type, omitting the unbox operator from the mapped type \code{t}. Thus no support for accessing
the referenced union is provided. The reason is, that access to the union as a whole is mostly useless
and further access to the union mebers cannot be provided. For consistency, Gencot treats union types
in the same way as struct types.

A pointer type \code{t*} where \code{t} is a primitive type, an enum type, 
or again a pointer type is mapped to a boxed record with a single field \code{cont} of the type \code{T} to which \code{t} is 
mapped. For every such type the generic type \code{CPtr T} name is used. This makes the 
Cogent program slightly more readable. 

The resulting generic type can be completely defined in Cogent as
\begin{verbatim}
  type CPtr ref = { cont: ref }
\end{verbatim}
it is predefined in file \code{include/gencot/CPointer.cogent}.

Values of such types are binary compatible to the C pointer type and they can be dereferenced with the help of
the Cogent take and put operations, thus supporting the full functionality of the C pointer.

A pointer type \code{t*} where \code{t} is an array type is mapped to the mapped (boxed) array type 
\begin{verbatim}
  CArr<size> El
\end{verbatim}
This approach is similar as for struct and union types: the pointer type is mapped to the plain boxed type,
the base type is mapped to the corresponding unboxed type. The difference in case of array pointers is, that also the base
type is often ``adjusted'' to the boxed type, because in C a pointer is used instead. Other than in C, however, Gencot
represents adjusted arrays by a pointer to the array as a whole, instead of as a pointer to the first element, because
this preserves more information about the array.

Finally, a pointer to \code{void} is mapped to the abstract type
\begin{verbatim}
  CVoidPtr
\end{verbatim}
defined in \code{include/gencot/CPointer.cogent}.
It is intended as a placeholder. Here the type of the referenced data is unknown. In C it is typically used 
as a generic pointer type which is cast to specific types of referenced values. This cannot be transferred to
Cogent, to be used, the type must be replaced manually. No C type definition is provided for it by Gencot.

Together we have the mapping rules for pointer types:
\begin{verbatim}
  void * -> CVoidPtr
  struct s * -> Struct_s = { ... }
  union s * -> Union_s
  (*el)[...] -> CArr... El
  otherwise: t * -> CPtr T
\end{verbatim}
where \code{Struct\_s} and \code{Union\_s} are the names introduced for the struct or union types and \code{El} 
and \code{T} are the Cogent types to which \code{el} and \code{t} are mapped, respectively.

To make the construction of a pointer type for a given Cogent type more generic (in particular for its use 
in other preprocessor macros), Gencot provides in \code{include/gencot/CPointer.cogent} the preprocessor macro
\begin{verbatim}
  CPTR(<knd>,<type>)
\end{verbatim}
where \code{<type>} is a Cogent type and \code{<knd>} is \code{U} or empty. \code{CPTR(U,T)} expands to \code{T} and
must be used if the \code{<type>} is an unboxed type of the form \code{\#Struct\_s}, \code{\#Union\_s}, or
\code{\#(Carr<size> El)}. \code{CPTR(,T)} expands to \code{(CPtr T)} and must be used in all other cases.

\subsubsection{Mapping Function Pointers}

In Cogent the distinction between function types and function pointer types does not exist. 
A Cogent function type of the form \code{T1 -> T2} is used both when
defining functions and when binding functions to variables. If used in a function definition, it is mapped by
the Cogent compiler to the corresponding C function type, as described in Section~\ref{design-types-function}.

In other places, however, Cogent does not translate its function types to C function pointers. Instead, it uses 
a C enumeration type where every known function has an associated enumeration constant. Whenever a 
function is bound to a variable, passed as a parameter or is invoked through a function pointer, it is 
represented by this enumeration constant in C, i.e., by an integer value.
For function invocation Cogent generates dispatcher functions which receive the integer value as an argument
and invoke the corresponding C function. 

Binary compatibility is only relevant when a function is stored, then it is always represented by the enumeration
constant in C generated from Cogent. Thus, a C function pointer type cannot be mapped by Gencot to a Cogent function type,
since this will not be binary compatible. Instead, it must be mapped to a Cogent abstract type together with 
abstract functions which translate between the abstract type and the Cogent function type (needed when invoking 
the function in Cogent).

Together, Gencot treats C function types and C function pointer types in completely different ways. It maps
C function types to Cogent function types and it maps C function pointer types to Cogent abstract types.

These abstract types treat C function pointers in Cogent as fully opaque values. The only operation which can 
be applied to them is to translate them to the enumeration value used in Cogent. This is done by comparing the
actual pointer values for equality. Since this can be done in C independent from the pointer's type, a single 
common C pointer type such as \code{void *} is sufficient. Accordingly, a single abstract type in Cogent is
sufficient to represent all C function pointers. In particular, no dependencies on the parameter or result types 
need to be known by Cogent to position their definitions before the first use of the type in C. 

However, for the developer the information about the parameter and result types are useful. Moreover, if different
Cogent types are used for different C function pointer types, the Cogent type checker can be used to find
mistakes. Since the full information about the parameter and result types is contained in the Cogent function types
the easiest way is to use a generic abstract type
\begin{verbatim}
  CFunPtr (P -> R)
\end{verbatim}
with a function type \code{P->R} as single type argument. It is used for complete function pointer types where the 
parameter types are specified or it is specified that the function has no parameters using the keyword \code{void}. 
This can be thought of as an ``annotated'' or ``wrapped'' function type, although the constraint that the argument
must be a function type cannot be specified or checked in Cogent.

For a complete C function pointer type its base type is translated to a Cogent function type as described in
Section~\ref{design-types-function}. This includes the cases for variadic function types and the cases where
parameter types are converted to readonly types or cause additional components in the result type for returning 
modified parameters.

For incomplete C function pointer types, where only the result type
is specified but no parameter types, a second generic abstract type is used:
\begin{verbatim}
  CFunInc R
\end{verbatim}
where \code{R} is the result type. It may be an arbitrary 
mapped C type, only restricted by the C rules that it may not be a function or array type. Since however C array types
are always mapped by wrapping them in a record, the corresponding unboxed types of the form \code{\#(CArr<size> El)}
\textit{can} be used as function result types, although Gencot will never do so when translating a valid C program.

Both generic abstract types are defined in \code{include/gencot/CPointer.cogent}.

Although the C function pointer is a pointer, the pointer target value (the machine code implementing the function) 
normally cannot be modified through the pointer. Hence, semantically a function pointer type does not correspond to a linear type
in Cogent, it could be represented by a readonly type or by an unboxed type. Gencot uses an unboxed type
since values of readonly types cannot escape from banged contexts. Gencot automatically applies the 
unbox operator in the form \code{\#(CFunPtr (P->R))} whenever it uses one of the two generic function pointer types.

However, if a function pointer type of these forms occurs as type of a struct member, any direct or indirect reference of a
parameter or result type to the struct type will be detected by Cogent as a cyclic type dependency. Since 
these dependencies seem to be no problem for the validation, Gencot hides the parameter and result types from
Cogent by encoding the function type as an abstract type name (see Section~\ref{design-names}). As a result, for 
every function type which is used as base type for a function pointer type there are now two forms: the Cogent
type expression of the form \code{P -> R} and the abstract type name. Semantically, both are equivalent, however,
this equivalence is deliberately hidden from the Cogent type checker. For incomplete function pointer types similar
abstract type names are required for arbitrary non-function types.

When generating the abstract type name the goal is to use the same name 
for every occurrence of a C function pointer type. Thus it is infeasible to generate the name from 
the occurrence position (file name and line number). If an arbitrarily generated name would be used, 
Gencot could not separately compile different C files. Therefore the name is generated by encoding the structure of the 
C function or result type. Gencot implements the encoding for all mapped C types. As described
in Section~\ref{design-names} the encoding also supports the type operators for unboxed and readonly types.
Modified function parameters are not added to the result type, they are marked as parameter type instead.

Now both kinds of function pointer types are mapped to the forms
\begin{verbatim}
  CFunPtr Encfuntype
  CFunInc Encrestype
\end{verbatim}
with the abstract encodings as type arguments. Again, this constraint cannot be specified or checked in Cogent.

If a mapped function type and the corresponding mapped function pointer type are used in the same context it is useful to 
be able to syntactically generate both from a common specification with the help of a preprocessor macro. This can be
supported by using the abstract type name also to define a synonym for the function type using another parameterized
type of the form
\begin{verbatim}
  type CFun Encfuntype = P->R
\end{verbatim}
Note that this cannot be expressed in Cogent syntax or with the help of antiquoted C, since the type \code{P->R} must
correspond to the encoding used as type argument. The Gencot mechanism for defining instances of polymorphic types and
functions must be used here, as described in Section~\ref{impl-operations}.

Another possibility is to use monomorphic abstract types instead. They have the form
\begin{verbatim}
  CFunPtr_Encfuntype
  CFunInc_Encrestype
  type CFun_Encfuntype = P->R
\end{verbatim}
It has the advantage that the function type synonyms can be defined using the normal Cogent syntax.

Due to an error in the Cogent compiler which does not treat types of the form \code{\#(A B)} as unboxed, if \code{A}
and \code{B} are abstract, the current Gencot version uses this approach.

Together the rules for mapping a function pointer type are
\begin{verbatim}
  t (*)( ... ) -> #CFunPtr_encfuntype
  t (*)() -> #CFunInc_encrestype
\end{verbatim}
where \code{encfuntype} is the encoding of the function type \code{t( ... )} 
and \code{encrestype} is the encoding of the result type \code{t}.

As additional convenience, for every complete function pointer type a Cogent type name of the form \code{CFun\_encfuntype}
is introduced for the base function type. This makes it easy to generate both types from \code{encfuntype} in a preprocessor
macro.

For example, the C function pointer type \code{int (*)(int, int[10])} is mapped to the abstract type
\begin{verbatim}
  #CFunPtr_FXU32XA10_U32X_U32
\end{verbatim}
with generated type definitions
\begin{verbatim}
  type CFunPtr_FXU32XA10_U32X_U32
  type CFun_FXU32XA10_U32X_U32 =
    (U32,CArr10 U32) -> U32
\end{verbatim}

Note that the macro call \code{CPTR(,T)} expands to \code{(CPtr T)} also if \code{T} is a Cogent function type.
This corresponds to a pointer to the function enumeration value used by Cogent and is not related to the C
function pointer type.

\subsection{Defined Type Names}
\label{design-types-typedef}

In C a typedef can be used to define a name for every possible type. In principle, it would be possible to
map a typedef name by resolving it to its type and then mapping this type as described above. However, the
typedef name often bears information for the programmer, hence the goal for Gencot is to preserve this information
and map the typedef name to the corresponding Cogent type name which is defined by translating the typedef
to a Cogent type definition.

Moreover, when a C type is derived from a typedef name, Gencot also maps the derived type using the mapped typedef name
as type argument in the corresponding parameterized type or type encoding. Since the mapped typedef name is defined to be a synonym 
for the mapped type definition, the resulting parameterized Cogent type is equivalent to the mapping of the derived 
type with the resolved typedef name as base type.

An exception from this rule are typedef names for struct, union, and array types. Mapping pointer types derived 
from such typedef names with the help of \code{CPtr} would result in the following situation:
\begin{verbatim}
  typedef struct s snam
  mapping: struct s -> #Struct_s
  mapping: struct s * -> Struct_s
  mapping: snam -> Cogent_snam
  mapping: snam * -> CPtr Cogent_snam
\end{verbatim}
where \code{Struct\_s} is the name of the Cogent record type corresponding to \code{struct s}. The problem here
is that for the mapped typedef name the pointer corresponds to a pointer to pointer to struct which is not binary 
compatible with the mapped struct pointer.

Therefore Gencot treats every typedef name resolving to a struct, union, or array type as if 
it would resolve to the corresponding pointer type. The plain name is mapped with the unbox operator 
applied (for arrays depending on the usage context), the pointer type derived from it is mapped without 
unbox operator applied. 

Special treatment is also required for the abstract type names used for representing function pointer types, as
described in Section~\ref{design-types-pointer}. For them substitutability of contained type names (i.e. substituting
a Cogent type name by its definition results in an equivalent type) is no more automatic, if mapped typedef names 
are used in names constructed by the type encoding rules from Section~\ref{design-names}. To provide substitutability
for such types Gencot explicitly defines every occurring type encoding which contains mapped type names as a synonym for the
encoding of the fully resolved type. Through transitivity of the type equivalence relation this results in full
substitutability for all type encodings and makes it feasible to use mapped typedef names also in type encodings.

The form of the actual type synonym definitions depends on the approach used for constructing function pointer type 
mappings using type encodings (see Section~\ref{design-types-pointer}). If generic types are used which take the encoding
as type argument, only one synonym definition of the form 
\begin{verbatim}
  type Enctype = Encresolvtype
\end{verbatim}
is required for every occuring type encoding \code{Enctype} with embedded mapped typedef names. 

In particular, if the base type of a function pointer type is a typedef name for a function type, this makes the mapped
typedef name \code{Enctype} a synonym for the fully resolved function type \textit{encoding} instead of the function type itself.
However, this is not a problem: in C a typedef name for a function type cannot be used for defining a function of that type, 
since a definition must always include the parameter names. A C typedef name for a function type can only be used
for declaring functions and for constructing the corresponding C function pointer type, either explicitly or implicitly 
by adjustment. So for every use of the second kind it must be mapped to a (synonym for an) encoding anyways, and a synonym 
for the Cogent function type is never required. Function declarations are only translated to Cogent for external functions,
resulting in abstract function definitions for exit wrappers. Here the function type name is resolved to the function type.

If monomorphic types are
used, a synonym definition is required for every type constructed from such a type encoding:
\begin{verbatim}
  type CFunPtr_Encfuntype = CFunPtr_Encresolvfuntype
  type CFunInc_Encrestype = CFunInc_Encresolvrestype
\end{verbatim}
Here, if \code{Encfuntype} is a mapped function type name, no synonym is defined for it in isolation. Therefore it can 
be used as synonym for the corresponding Cogent function type. Like function pointer type names it is always used with
the unbox operator applied, to make apparent that it is no linear type.

The resulting mapping rules are for function type names:
\begin{verbatim}
  tn -> #TN
  tn* -> #CFunPtr_TN
\end{verbatim}
for names of function pointer types:
\begin{verbatim}
  tn -> #TN
\end{verbatim}
for names of a struct or union type:
\begin{verbatim}
  tn -> #TN
  tn* -> TN
\end{verbatim}
for names of an array type:
\begin{verbatim}
  tn -> TN, #TN
  tn* -> TN
\end{verbatim}
depending on its usage context for \code{tn}, 
and for all other type names:
\begin{verbatim}
  tn -> TN
\end{verbatim}
where \code{TN} is the name mapping of \code{tn}.

This implies, that also the Cogent type definitions generated from a C typedef have to be modified, if
the target type is a struct, union, or array type. In this case Gencot translates the typedef 
to a Cogent type definition which defines the mapped typedef name as a synonym 
for the corresponding boxed type in Cogent.

If the target type is a function type Gencot does not translate a typedef to a Cogent type definition, if
type encodings are used for representing function pointer types.
If the typedef name is used in derived types, synonyms will automatically be defined which resolve the 
mapped type name to the encoding of the resolved type, as described above.

\subsection{Linear and Readonly Types}
\label{design-types-readonly}

C types can be qualified as \code{const}. This means, the values of the type are immutable and could be stored in 
a readonly memory. A variable declared with a readonly type is initialized with a value and cannot be modified 
afterwards. The immutability of an aggregate type also implies that values cannot be modified by modifying parts: 
for a struct the fields cannot be modified and for an array the elements cannot be modified. This behavior corresponds 
to the behavior of all primitive and unboxed types in Cogent. 

If a C type is not qualified as \code{const}, stored values of the type may be modified. This may have non-local
effects if the stored value is shared (part of several other values). In Cogent, values of primitive and unboxed types
cannot be shared (only copies can be part of other values). Therefore a modification of the C value always corresponds to
replacing the value bound to a variable in Cogent. This can be represented by binding the new value to a variable
of the same name which will shadow the previous binding. Together, this means that a \code{const} qualifier is
irrelevant whenever a C type is translated to a primitive or unboxed type in Cogent.

The situation is different for C pointer types which are translated to linear types in Cogent. Values of linear types
may be modified using put and take operations in Cogent, but they are restricted in their use. Put and take operations
correspond to modifications of the value referenced by the pointer. Thus, a \code{const} qualification of the pointer
type is still irrelevant for them, however, a \code{const} qualification of the pointer's \textit{base type} means
that put and take operations are not possible. This case is supported by Cogent as readonly types, which are not
restricted in their use in the same way as linear types.

Note, however, that Cogent does not separate between pointers and their referenced values: the referenced value
is treated as part of the linear value. If the referenced value itself contains references, the values referenced
by them are also treated as part of the overall value. This implies, that a readonly type in Cogent corresponds to
a C pointer type with \code{const} qualified base type where all components with a pointer type transitively have
the same property.

It further implies, that a C type also corresponds to a linear type in Cogent, if it directly or indirectly 
\textit{contains} pointers where the base type is not \code{const} qualified. This may be the case for struct or union
types (members may have such pointer types) or for array types (the elements may have such a pointer type).

An exception are C pointers to functions. It is assumed that the function code cannot be modified, hence a C pointer 
to function is treated like a primitive type in Cogent.

Gencot tests every C type for being a pointer or containing a pointer. If this is the case, the translated Cogent 
type is known to be linear. The C type is then further tested whether all pointers have a \code{const} qualified
base type. If this is the case, the type is translated to a Cogent readonly type,
by applying the bang operator \code{!} to the type after translating it as described in Section~\ref{design-types-pointer}.

In particular, the readonly property is valid for all pointer types where the base type is \code{const} qualified 
and contains no pointers, such as \code{const char*}.
