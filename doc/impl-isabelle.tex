As described in Section~\ref{design-isabelle} Gencot extends the shallow embedding and 
the refinement proofs generated by Cogent. This is implemented by
\begin{itemize}
\item providing predefined Isabelle code as theory files. These files are located 
in the Gencot distribution in the subfolder \code{isa}.
\item generating additional Isabelle code in separate theory files, if it depends 
on the translated C program.
\item modifying Isabelle code which has been generated by Cogent. This is only done
in cases where there is no other solution possible.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Extending the Shallow Embedding}
\label{impl-isabelle-shallow}

\subsubsection{Theory File Structure}

The shallow embedding generated by Cogent for a program \code{X} consists of two Isabelle theory files. The file 
\code{X\_ShallowShared.thy} contains definitions for all types occurring in the Cogent program and declarations
for all abstract functions in the Cogent program. The file \code{X\_Shallow\_Desugar.thy} contains definitions 
for all non-abstract functions defined in the Cogent program.

This shallow embedding is transformed by Gencot to the following set of files:
\begin{description}
\item[\code{GencotTypes.thy}:] this file is predefined and contains definitions used for implementing the Gencot 
types in Isabelle.
\item[\code{X\_ShallowShared.thy}:] this is a modified form of the file generated by Cogent, where some type 
declarations and type synonym definitions have been replaced. The file additionally imports \code{GencotTypes.thy}
since its content may be used in the replaced type specifications.
\item[\code{X\_Shallow\_Desugar.thy}:] this is the original file as generated by Cogent.
\item[\code{ShallowShared.thy}:] this is a program specific file generated by Gencot. It only contains an import of 
\code{X\_ShallowShared.thy}. It serves as an interface so that the content of \code{X\_ShallowShared.thy} can be
imported in predefined files without the need to know the program specific prefix \code{X}.
\item[\code{Gencot\_TTT.thy}:] these are predefined files for every Gencot include file \code{TTT.cogent} which defines
abstract Cogent functions. They import \code{GencotTypes.thy} and \code{ShallowShared.thy} and define Isabelle
specifications for the abstract Cogent functions defined in \code{TTT.cogent}.
\item[\code{CogentCommon\_ttt.thy}:] these are predefined files for some Cogent include files \code{ttt.cogent} in the 
Cogent standard library \code{gum/common} which define abstract Cogent functions. They import \code{ShallowShared.thy}
and define Isabelle specifications for the abstract Cogent functions defined in \code{ttt.cogent}
\item[\code{X\_Shallow\_Embedding.thy}:] this is a program specific file generated by Gencot. It imports 
\code{X\_Shallow\_Desugar.thy} and all \code{Gencot\_TTT.thy} and \code{CogentCommon\_ttt.thy} for which \code{TTT.cogent}
or \code{ttt.cogent} is used in the Cogent program, respectively. It may contain additional program specific parts
of the shallow embedding. 
\end{description}

Together, the Gencot shallow embedding for a program \code{X} is made available in an Isabelle theory file by importing
\code{X\_Shallow\_Embedding.thy}. This file structure is designed with the goal to reduce modifications and program 
specific parts, which must be generated, to an absolute minimum.

The predefined files \code{GencotTypes.thy}, \code{Gencot\_TTT.thy} and \code{CogentCommon\_ttt.thy} are provided in 
directory \code{isa} in the Gencot distribution. However, they cannot be loaded directly from there by Isabelle, 
since they depend on the program specific file \code{ShallowShared.thy} and no complete session can be defined for 
them in the Gencot distribution. For a complete shallow embedding which can be loaded by Isabelle the predefined
files must be copied from the Gencot distribution to the directory where the other files have been generated. Then 
a session can be defined for them in a \code{ROOT} file there.

It would be possible to determine from the imports in \code{X\_Shallow\_Embedding.thy} exactly those predefined
files which are needed for a specific shallow embedding. However, transitive imports among the predefined files
must be taken into account. Therefore a simpler solution is to always copy all predefined theory files to a 
specific shallow embedding, independent of which are actually needed.
