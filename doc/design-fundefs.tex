A C function definition is translated by Gencot to a Cogent function definition. Old-style C function definitions
where the parameter types are specified by separate declarations between the parameter list and the function body
are not supported by Gencot because of the additional complexity of comment association.

The Cogent function name is generated from the C function name as described in Section~\ref{design-names}.

The Cogent function type is generated from the C function result type and from all C parameter types as described
in Section~\ref{design-types-function}. In a C
function definition the types for all parameters must be specified in the parameter list, if old-style function
definitions are ignored.

\subsection{Function Bodies}
\label{design-fundefs-body}

In C the function body consists of a compound statement which is specified in imperative programming style. In Cogent
the function body consists of an expression which is specified in functional programming style with additional 
restrictions which are crucial for proving properties of the Cogent program. Therefore Gencot does not try
to translate function bodies, this must be done by a human programmer.

It would be possible, however, to translate C declarations embedded in the body. These may be type definitions
and definitions for local variables. However, there are no good choices for the generated target code. Type
definitions cannot be local in an expression in Cogent, they must be moved to the toplevel where they may cause
conflicts. Local variable definitions could be translated to Cogent variable bindings in let-expressions, however,
C assignments cannot be translated for them. Also, the resulting mixture of C code and Cogent code is expected 
to be quite confusing to the programmer who has to do the manual translation. Therefore, no declarations in 
function bodies are processed by Gencot.

The only processing done for function bodies is the substitution of names occurring free in the body. These may
be names with global scope (for types, functions, tags, global variables, enum constants or preprocessor constants)
or parameter names. For all names with global scope Gencot has generated a Cogent definition using a mapped name.
These names are substituted in the C code of the function body by the corresponding mapped names so that the 
mapping need not be done manually by the programmer.

Names with local scope (either local variables or types/tags) are also mapped by Gencot, both in their (local)
definition and whenever they are used. 

The mapping does not include the mapping of derived types. Type derivation in C is done in declarators which refer
a common type specification in a declaration. In Cogent there is no similar concept, every declarator must be 
translated to a separate declaration. This is not done due to the reasons described above. As result, a translated
local declaration may have the form
\begin{verbatim}
  Struct_s1 a, *b, c[5];
\end{verbatim}
although the Cogent types for \code{a, b, c} would be \code{\#Struct\_s1}, \code{Struct\_s1}, and 
\code{\#(CArr5 Struct\_s1)}, respectively. This translation for the derived types must be done manually.

Additionally, the function parameter names usually occur free in the function body. To make them apparent to
the programmer, Gencot generates a Cogent pattern for the (single) parameter of the Cogent function which 
consists of a tuple of variables with the names generated from the C parameter names. As described in 
Section~\ref{design-names} the C parameter names are only mapped if they are uppercase, otherwise they are
translated to Cogent unmodified. If they are mapped they are substituted in the body. Since it is very unusual
to use uppercase parameter names in C, the Cogent function will normally use the original C parameter names.

If the function is variadic an additional last tuple component is added with a variable named
\code{variadicCogentParameters}, mainly to inform the developer that manual action is required.

Global variables referenced in a function body are treated in a specific way. If the global variable has a 
Global-State property (see Section~\ref{design-types-itemprops}) and a virtual parameter item with the same
property has been declared for the function, the identifier of the global variable is replaced by the 
mapped parameter name with the dereference operator applied. This corresponds to the intended purpose of the 
Global-State properties: instead of accessing global variables directly from within a function, a pointer is 
passed as parameter and the variable is accessed by dereferencing this pointer.

If a global variable has the Const-Val property (see Section~\ref{design-types-itemprops}) its access is
replaced by an invocation of the corresponding parameterless access function. If the global variable has 
neither of these properties declared, Gencot simply uses its mapped name, this case must be handled manually.

If the C function body would be directly written into the Cogent source file, it cannot be syntax checked by the 
Cogent compiler. Therefore it is wrapped as a Cogent comment by adding a \code{-} sign immediately after the
opening brace and before the closing brace.

To yield a correct Cogent function, a dummy result expression is generated. Gencot generates the expression
depending on the result type, as described in Section~\ref{design-operations-dummy}. 

The generated Cogent function definition has the form
\begin{verbatim}
  <name> :: (<ptype1>, ..., <ptypen>) -> <restype>
  <name> (<pname1>, ..., <pnamen>) = <dummy result>
  {- <compound statement> -}
\end{verbatim}
where the \code{<compound statement>} is plain C code with substituted names.

\subsection{Comments in Function Definitions}
\label{design-fundefs-comments}

A C function definition which is not old-style syntactically consists of a declaration with a single declarator
and the compound statement for the body.
It is treated by Gencot as a structured source code part with the declaration and the body as subparts
without any main part code. According to the structures of declarations the declaration has the single declarator as subpart
and optionally a full specifier, if present. The declarator has the parameter declarations as subparts.

\subsubsection{Function Header}

The target code part for the declaration and for its single declarator is the header of the Cogent function definition
(first two lines in the schema in the previous section). The target code part for the full specifiers with tags in
the declaration (which may be present for the result type and for each parameter) is a sequence of corresponding 
type definitions, as described for declarations in Section~\ref{design-decls-tags}, which is placed 
after the Cogent function definition. The target code part for full specifiers without tags is the generated type
expression embedded in the Cogent type for the corresponding parameter or the result.

All parameter declarations consist of a single declarator and the optional full specifier. The target code part for
a parameter declaration and its declarator is the corresponding parameter type in the Cogent function type expression.
Hence, comments associated with parameter declarations in C are moved to the parameter type expression in Cogent.

\subsubsection{Function Body}

To preserve comments embedded in the C function body it is also considered as a structured source code part. Its 
subpart structure corresponds to the syntactic structure of the C AST. Since in the target code only identifiers 
are substituted, the target code
structure is the same as that of the source code. The structure is only used for identifying and re-inserting
the transferrable comments and preprocessor directives. Note that this works only if the conditional directive 
structure is compatible with the syntactic structure, i.e., a group must always contain a complete syntactical
unit such as a statement, expression or declaration, which is the usual case in C code in practice.

An alternative approach would be to treat all nonempty source code lines as subparts of a function body, resulting
in a flat sequence structure of single lines. The advantage is that it is always compatible to the conditional 
directive structure and
all comment units would be transferred. However, generating the corresponding origin markers in an abstract syntax
tree is much more complex than generating them for syntactical units for which the origin information is present
in the syntax tree. Since the Gencot implementation generates the
target code as an abstract syntax tree, the syntactical statement structure is preferred. 

\subsection{Entry Wrappers}
\label{design-fundefs-wrapper}

The C function definitions are also used for generating the entry wrappers as described in Section~\ref{design-modular}.
For every definition of a C function with external linkage an entry wrapper is generated in antiquoted C.

The main task of the entry wrapper is to convert the seperate function arguments to an argument tuple which is passed
to the corresponding Cogent function. If the C function has only one argument it is passed directly. If the C 
function has no argument the unit value must be passed to the Cogent function.

The entry wrapper has the same interface (name, arguments, argument types, result type) as the original C function.
However, since the wrapper is a part of the Cogent compilation unit, the argument and result types used in the 
original function definition are not available. They must be replaced by the binary compatible types generated 
from their translation to Cogent types (see Section~\ref{design-types}). This is accomplished by using the Cogent
types in antiquoted form.

If the original C function definition has the signature
\begin{verbatim}
  <type0> fnam(<type1> arg1, ..., <typen> argn)
\end{verbatim}
the entry wrapper has the signature
\begin{verbatim}
  $ty:(<cogt0>) fnam($ty:(<cogt1>) arg1, ..., $ty:(<cogtn>) argn)
\end{verbatim}
where \code{<cogti>} is the translation of \code{<typei>} to Cogent. It would be possible to generate synthetic 
parameter names for the wrapper, however, since the original parameter names must always be specified in the 
original function definition, Gencot uses them in the wrapper signature for simplicity and better readability.

If there is more than one function argument (\code{n > 1}), the wrapper must convert them to the C implementation
of the Cogent tuple value used as argument for the Cogent function (see Section~\ref{design-types-function}).
Cogent tuples are implemented as C struct types with members named \code{"p1"}, \code{"p2"}, \ldots in the order
of the tuple components. Since tuple types are always unboxed, the C structs are allocated on the stack. Thus
the body of an entry wrapper with \code{n > 1} has the form
\begin{verbatim}
  $ty:((<cogt1>,...,<cogtn>)) arg = 
    {.p1=arg1,..., .pn=argn};
  return cogent_fnam(arg);
\end{verbatim}

If \code{n = 1} no tuple needs to be constructed and the wrapper body has the form
\begin{verbatim}
  return cogent_fnam(arg1);
\end{verbatim}

If \code{n = 0} the C implementation of the Cogent unit value must be constructed. It is a C struct with 
a single member named \code{"dummy"} of type \code{int}. The corresponding wrapper body has the form
\begin{verbatim}
  $ty:(()) arg = {.dummy=0};
  return cogent_fnam(arg);
\end{verbatim}

If the C function has no result, i.e., \code{<type0>} is \code{void}, no result is returned by the entry
wrapper. Then the last statement in its body has the form
\begin{verbatim}
  cogent_fnam(arg);
\end{verbatim}

If the C function has the Heap-Use property (see Section~\ref{design-types-itemprops}), a component of type
\code{Heap} is added to the Cogent function's argument tuple and the result is converted to a tuple where the
original result is the first component. In C the heap is accessed globally, therefore these components can 
be ignored. However, the wrapper implementation has to take care of them. Type \code{Heap} is implemented by
Gencot simply by the C type \code{int} and a \code{0} is passed as its value. The entry wrapper body for a
function with Heap-Use property has the form
\begin{verbatim}
  $ty:((<cogt1>,...,<cogtn>,Heap)) arg = 
    {.p1=arg1,..., .pn=argn, .pn+1=0};
  return cogent_fnam(arg).p1;
\end{verbatim}
if \code{n > 0} and
\begin{verbatim}
  return cogent_fnam(0).p1;
\end{verbatim}
if \code{n = 0}.

If atleast one of the C function arguments has the Add-Result property, the result is also converted to a tuple 
whith the original result as its first component. In this case the last statement in the wrapper's body also 
has the form
\begin{verbatim}
  return cogent_fnam(arg).p1;
\end{verbatim}
if the C function's result is not \code{void}.

If the C function has virtual parameters with Global-State properties declared in the item properties, references
to the corresponding global variables are passed to these parameters by the entry wrapper. For a parameter with 
Global-State property the corresponding variable is determined by searching all known toplevel items for an
item with a Global-State property with the same numerical argument. Since every global variable must use a 
different numerical argument, this search will result in a single toplevel item identifier. 

If the function does not access the global variable and uses the virtual parameter only to pass the variable 
reference to invoked function, it may be the case that the variable is not visible in the C source file, because
it is neither defined nor declared there. However, the name used in (antiquoted) C for the variable can always 
be constructed from the item identifier alone. No other information about the variable is needed to generate the 
entry wrapper.

Assume that a C function has two virtual parameters with Global-State properties with numerical arguments 
\code{0} and \code{3}. The global variable associated with argument \code{0} has name \code{gvar} and external linkage,
the global variable associated with argument \code{3} has name \code{table} and is defined in source file \code{scan.c}
with internal linkage. Then the entry wrapper body has the form
\begin{verbatim}
  $ty:((<cogt1>,...,<cogtn>,GlobState,GlobState3)) arg = 
    {.p1=arg1,..., .pn=argn, .pn+1=&gvar, .pn+2=&local_scan_table};
  return cogent_fnam(arg).p1;
\end{verbatim}


If a parameter has the Modification-Function property the argument and result of the Cogent functions are
represented as pairs where the second component may be a tuple (see Section~\ref{design-types-function}). 
The wrapper must rearrange the parameters and retrieve the original result. For example, if the C 
function has 3 parameters, the second parameter has the Modification-Function property and the Add-Result 
property, and the third parameter has the Add-Result property the Cogent function has type
\begin{verbatim}
  (<cogt2>, (<cogt1>, <cogt3>)) -> (<cogt2>, (<cogt0>, <cogt3>))
\end{verbatim}
and the entry wrapper body has the form
\begin{verbatim}
  $ty:((<cogt2>,(<cogt1>,<cogt3>))) arg = 
    {.p1=arg2,.p2={.p1=arg1,.p2=arg3}};
  return cogent_fnam(arg).p2.p1;
\end{verbatim}

Together, the information required to generate the entry wrapper is the same as that for translating the 
function's type to Cogent: the argument types and the result type must be translated to Cogent and the
function name must be mapped to determine the name of the Cogent function.

\subsection{Object Definitions}
\label{design-fundefs-object}

Gencot processes object declarations with block-scope (``local variables'') as described in Section~\ref{design-fundefs-body} 
by simply mapping the object name. 

A toplevel (``external'') object definition (with ``file-scope'') either has an initializer or is a ``tentative definition''
according to the C standard. Such an object definition defines a global variable. Gencot treats global variables
as described in Section~\ref{design-modular}.

If the global variable has a Global-State property (see Section~\ref{design-types-itemprops}) Gencot introduces a type 
synonym of the form \code{GlobState<i>}. The type synonym definition is generated in the translated Cogent source 
at the place where the object definition was in the C source and is marked with the corresponding origin. The 
type synonym name is determined form the numerical argument of the Global-State property, the right-hand side of
the type definition is the translation of the derived pointer type of the variable's type, translated according to
Section~\ref{design-types}.

If the global variable has the Const-Val property (see Section~\ref{design-types-itemprops}) Gencot introduces an abstract 
parameterless access function in Cogent in the form
\begin{verbatim}
  <name> : () -> <type>
\end{verbatim}
where \code{<name>} is the mapped variable name and \code{<type>} is the translation of the variable's defined type.
If the defined type is a struct, union, or array type, the translation of the derived pointer type is used instead,
with a bang operator applied to make it readonly. The access function definition is generated in the translated Cogent source 
at the place where the object definition was in the C source and is marked with the corresponding origin.

Independent from its item properties, the object definition is translated to antiquoted C and added to the file 
containing the entry wrappers. In this way all global variables are still present in the Cogent compilation unit.
The translated definition uses as type the antiquoted Cogent type which results from translating the type specified 
in the object definition. For an object with external linkage the name is the original name, so that the object can still
be referred from outside the Cogent compilation unit, and the linkage is external. For an object with internal linkage
the name is mapped as described in Section~\ref{design-names} so that it is unique in the Cogent compilation unit, and
the linkage is internal. If an initializer is present in the original definition it is transferred to the antiquoted
definition, mapping all referenced names of global variables with internal linkage.

The entry wrappers and object definitions are placed in the antiquoted C file in the same order as the original function
and object definitions. Additionally, all global variables are declared together with all external functions in a 
file included before all entry wrapper files, so that entry
wrappers defined before the variable can still pass a pointer to it to the wrapped Cogent function.

If the global variable has the Const-Val property Gencot additionally creates an implementation of the access function
in antiquoted C and puts it immediately after the variable definition. Depending on the variable's type it returns its
value or a pointer to the variable.
