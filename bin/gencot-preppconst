# documentation:
# 
# A preprocessor constant definition is a parameterless macro definition with a nonempty replacement body.
# Definitions are omitted if the macro name is listed in the argument file.
#
# The output contains the masked constant definitions with line directives specifying the origin file and the 
# line offset in that file. Constant names in replacement bodies have been substituted by cpp.
#
# Implementation in awk:
# - Function mapname maps a macro name to a Cogent variable name, always starting with a lowercase letter.
# - In the BEGIN rule, if a file name is specified as argument, all lines from the file are read as 
#   strings. For every such string the entry in the boolean array omit is set to 1.
#   If no argument is specified or the file cannot be read the array omit has no entries.
# - lnr is a variable for counting line numbers. These are actual line numbers in the input, line directives
#   are not reflected. The variable is only used for indexing the buf array.
# - cont is a boolean variable which tells whether the next line is a continuation line for the
#   same directive. It is set according to whether there is a backslash at the end of the previous line.
#   This is detected by matching the line with the regular expression /\\$/.
# - Definitions to be processed are recognized as follows: The macro name in field $2 must not contain
#   an opening parenthesis (otherwise the macro would have parameters), it must not be marked in the omit array,
#   and either there must be additional fields in the same line or there must be at least one continuation line
#   (nonempty replacement body).
# - Line directives are recognized by the first field being "#". Since directives are normalized, in all
#   other cases the directive keyword must be part of the first field.
# - In the line rule two processing phases are combined. For every processed definition a mapping definition
#   is immediately output and a masked definition is added to the array buf, indexed by line numbers counted
#   in lnr. Continuation lines and line directives are only transferred to buf. Since all lines are counted
#   and empty lines are added to buf, the line position of the masked definitions in buf exactly correspond 
#   to their position in the input.
# - The mapping definitions are preceded by a line directive for the dummy file name "<mappings>" so that
#   their lines appear as included in the output and do not count to the content of "<stdin>".
# - In the END rule all masked definitions in buf are output.
