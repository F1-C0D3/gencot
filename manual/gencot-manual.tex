\chapter{Introduction}

Gencot (GENerating COgent Toolset) is a set of tools for generating Cogent code from C code. 

Gencot is used for parsing the C sources and generating Cogent sources, 
antiquoted C sources, and auxiliary C code. It does not perform a fully automatic translation, it is
intended to be used in combination with several manual steps of pre- and post-processing. These
steps are described in this manual.

The manual assumes that you are familiar with C and Cogent and know how to work with both.

\section{Rationale}
\label{intro-rationale}

Normally, Cogent is intended to implement from scratch a program which both compiles to a C implementation
and can be used as a high-level specification for formally verifying semantic properties.
Cogent generates a formal proof that the C implementation is a refinement of the high-level specification,
thus all proven semantic properties also hold for the C implementation.

Gencot is intended for the case where there already exists a legacy C implementation for a task. To apply
Cogent as described above, the task must be re-implemented in Cogent. Gencot supports this re-implementation 
by automatically translating several parts of the legacy C program to Cogent code. This should help developers 
to start with the re-implementation, especially if they have more experience in C programming than in Cogent.

However, Gencot does not provide the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item a guarantee, that the translation to Cogent is equivalent to the legacy C program. There is no formal
proof for such an equivalence and Gencot itself is not verified. Also, a part of the re-implementation must 
be done manually, so no automatic evidence can be provided. 

If you are lucky, there is a test suite for the legacy C program. Then you can apply the test suite to the 
Cogent re-implementation and get some evidence, that there is no difference in relevant behaviors. Even if
there is no test suite, building on the legacy C program should be easier and faster than to start the 
re-implementation from scratch. In any case, the formal verification starts at the Cogent program and does not 
extend to the legacy C program.

\item a guarantee that the translation to Cogent is type-safe and respects the constraints of the uniqueness
type system. Gencot translates the types as they are specified in the C program. It maps some memory safety
properties to the Cogent type system, but it does not make unsafe parts safe. In particular, if the legacy
C program shares and discards pointers, so will the translation to Cogent. 

The advantage is that the Cogent typechecker will statically detect all theses cases and signal them as an
error, so that the developer can concentrate on them. The Cogent program must then be refactored to avoid 
such cases, until it can be successfully processed by the Cogent compiler.

\item a guarantee that the translation to Cogent is useful for formally verifying the desired semantic properties. 
The Cogent program generated by Gencot has the same overall structure as the legacy C program. If this structure
is not adequate for formal proofs, e.g., because it massively depends on reading and modifying a global state,
the generated Cogent program (or the legacy C program) must be refactored to better support formal verification.
\end{itemize}

\section{Gencot Distribution}
\label{intro-dist}

The Gencot distribution consists of the following folders:
\begin{description}
\item[manual] this manual,
\item[bin] the main command scripts \code{gencot} and \code{parmod} and many auxiliary commands used by them,
\item[include] Cogent include files used by the generated code,
\item[c] C code implementing abstract types and functions used by the generated code,
\item[examples] example C programs used in this manual for introducing Gencot,
\item[src] the Haskell source code of Gencot components,
\item[doc] a comprehensive documentation of Gencot design and implementation.
\end{description}

Gencot is a command line tool. To use it make sure that you can invoke the commands \code{gencot}, \code{auxcog},
\code{parmod}, and \code{items} (e.g., by linking them in a folder in your command path or by adding the \code{bin} folder
of the Gencot distribution to your command path).

Additionally you have to set the environment variable \code{\$GENCOT\_HOME} to the root folder of the Gencot
distribution.

We also assume that you have a working distribution of Cogent and can invoke the cogent compiler using the
command \code{cogent}.

All example folders contain a UNIX Makefile. You can either run the examples by manually typing the commands
to process them or by using \code{make} with a separate target for each step.

\section{First Encounter}
\label{intro-first}

As usual we will start with a ``Hello World'' example. Go to \code{examples/helloworld}. Ignoring the other files,
look at \code{hello.c}. It contains the C program
\begin{verbatim}
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main() {
    puts("Hello World");
  }
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[Step 1:] (make run)

Try it: compile the program with a C compiler, name it \code{hello} and run it. It should do what you expect.

\item[Step 2:] (make all-cogent)

Now use Gencot to translate the program to Cogent. Enter the command
\begin{verbatim}
  gencot cfile hello.c
\end{verbatim}
It creates the file \code{hello.cogent}. Look at it. It contains
\begin{verbatim}
  cogent_main : () -> U32
  cogent_main () =
     0
     {-
         cogent_puts("Hello World");
     -}
\end{verbatim}
This is a Cogent function corresponding to the C function \code{main}. However, the function body is still C code
and put in comment. Instead, the dummy result \code{0} is used, so the file is already valid Cogent code.

The command also creates the file \code{hello-entry.ac} (Not yet implemented! Provided with the example).

Next enter the command
\begin{verbatim}
  gencot unit all.unit
\end{verbatim}
It creates the file \code{all.cogent} and three files \code{all-externs.cogent}, \code{all-exttypes.cogent}, 
and \code{all-dvdtypes.cogent} where the latter two are empty and can be ignored for this example. File 
\code{all-externs.cogent} contains
\begin{verbatim}
  cogent_puts : String -> U32
\end{verbatim}
which is also valid Cogent code and declares \code{cogent\_puts} as an abstract function. File \code{all.cogent}
includes all generated Cogent files and is the main source file to be processed by the Cogent compiler.

The command also creates the file \code{all-externs.ac} (Not yet implemented! Provided with the example).

\item[Step 3:] (make all-edit)

Now comes the part where your manual work is demanded. You have to translate the function bodies.
Open \code{hello.cogent} in a text editor, replace its content by
\begin{verbatim}
  cogent_main : () -> U32
  cogent_main () =
         cogent_puts("Hello World"); 0
\end{verbatim}
and save. 

Now you have a Cogent program which is equivalent to the original C program. It consists of several files,
which are all included by \code{all.cogent}.

\item[Step 4:] (make all-c)

To see that it works, process \code{all.cogent} by the Cogent compiler. Enter the command
\begin{verbatim}
  cogent -o all-gen -g all.cogent \
      --infer-c-funcs="all-externs.ac hello-entry.ac"
\end{verbatim}
It creates the files \code{all-gen.c} and \code{all-gen.h} and two \code{\_pp\_inferred.c} files. 

Gencot is required to perform some postprocessing steps. Enter the command
\begin{verbatim}
  auxcog unit all.unit
\end{verbatim}
It creates the file \code{all.c} which includes \code{all-gen.c} and the other files generated by \code{auxcog}. It wraps together 
the C program generated from the Cogent program by the Cogent compiler and the Gencot postprocessing step.

\item[Step 5:] (make all-run)

Try whether it still works. Compile \code{all.c} with a C compiler, name it \code{cogent-hello} and run it. The result should be the same
as in Step 1.

Note that for the compilation you need to set the include path to the standard library folder of the Cogent 
distribution (\code{STDGUM} in the Makefile) and to the \code{c} directory in the Gencot distribution. The latter contains the files
\code{gencot.h} and \code{cogent-common.c} which are included by \code{all.c}

\item[Step 6:] (make clean)

Clean up all generated files. If you like you can perform the steps again.
\end{description}

\chapter{C Program Structure}
\label{struct}

\section{Single Source File}
\label{struct-single}

The simplest case is a C program which consists of a single \code{.c} file, such as the ``Hello World'' program
introduced in Section~\ref{intro-first}. If the C file is named \code{foo.c} the command to process it by Gencot is
\begin{verbatim}
  gencot cfile foo.c
\end{verbatim}
It creates the following files:
\begin{description}
\item[\code{foo.cogent}] The content of \code{foo.c} translated to Cogent, as far as Gencot supports a translation.
Function bodies are not translated.
\item[\code{foo-entry.ac}] (*Not yet implemented*) ``Entry wrapper'' functions for all functions defined in \code{foo.c} 
with external linkage.
\end{description}

An ``entry wrapper'' converts from the original C function API to the Cogent function API, which is usually different 
since Cogent functions always take one argument and return one value. Functions in \code{foo.cogent} are automatically
renamed so that they do not collide with the entry wrappers after translation back to C by Cogent. For a standalone
C program there is atleast an entry wrapper \code{main} for the translated main program. Using the entry wrappers, all
translated C functions can still be invoked from a C program according to their original API.

Additionally, Gencot must be invoked using the command
\begin{verbatim}
  gencot unit all.unit
\end{verbatim}
where \code{all.unit} contains the name of the C source file (\code{"foo.c"}) in a single line. It creates the following
files:
\begin{description}
\item[\code{all-externs.cogent}] Abstract definitions of all external functions used by the C program.
\item[\code{all-exttypes.cogent}] Type definitions for all external types used by the C program.
\item[\code{all-dvdtypes.cogent}] Type definitions for all derived types used in the C program.
\item[\code{all-externs.ac}] (*Not yet implemented*) ``Exit wrapper'' functions for all functions defined in 
\code{all-externs.cogent}.
\item[\code{all.cogent}] The main Cogent source file which includes all other Cogent sources.
\end{description}
An external function is used by the C program if it is actually invoked. Such functions must be declared in C, usually
the declarations are contained in standard include files. In the ``Hello World'' example the file \code{hello.c} includes
\code{stdio.h} where function \code{puts} is declared. Here, Gencot reads \code{stdio.h} to generate the abstract definition for
\code{gencot\_puts} and the corresponding exit wrapper. Although there are many functions declared in \code{stdio.h}, Gencot
does not generate definitions for them, since they are not invoked by the C program.

An external type is a type defined in a standard include file. Again, Gencot provides a Cogent type definition in 
\code{all-exttypes.cogent} for only those 
types which are actually used by the C program. A derived type is a pointer type, an array type, or a function type in C. For 
some of them Gencot generates auxiliary type definitions in \code{all-dvdtypes.cogent}. In the ``Hello World'' example 
both files are empty.

An ``exit wrapper'' is similar to an ``entry wrapper'', it converts from the Cogent function API back to the C function API.
Exit wrappers are also renamed so that they do not collide with the originally invoked C function.

All generated files are named according to the name of the file argument to the \code{gencot} command. If the file is named 
\code{foo.unit} you will get \code{foo.cogent}, \code{foo-externs.cogent}, \code{foo-exttypes.cogent} etc.

\section{Single Source File with Include Files}
\label{struct-include}

Often, a C program consists of a \code{.c} file with function definitions and an included \code{.h} file for data type 
definitions. In this case Gencot must additionally be invoked for translating the \code{.h} file in the form
\begin{verbatim}
  gencot hfile foo.h
\end{verbatim}
It will create the additional file \code{foo-incl.cogent} which contains the translated content of \code{foo.h}. The 
include directive in \code{foo.c} will automatically be adapted, so that \code{foo.cogent} includes \code{foo-incl.cogent}.
So the resulting Cogent program has a similar source file structure as the C program.

If there are several \code{.h} files included by the \code{.c} file gencot must be invoked for every \code{.h} file
separately.

The other files are translated as before, however, the path must be specified where to look for the included files, even
if they are in the same directory. It is specified with an option \code{-I} as for \code{cpp}. Several such options may 
be specified if included files are in different directories. Include paths may be specified relative to the current 
directory. Do not append a slash \code{/} at the end. Paths for system include files cannot be specified, the \code{cpp} 
default is used for accessing them.

Together, the commands for translating the C program are
\begin{verbatim}
  gencot hfile foo.h
  ... <other .h files> ...
  gencot -I. cfile foo.c
  gencot -I. unit all.unit
\end{verbatim}
where \code{all.unit} still contains only the name \code{foo.c} and not \code{foo.h} (because that is automatically
read together with \code{foo.c} which includes it).

\subsection{Example}

The example program in \code{examples/cards} consists of the file \code{cards.c} and the included files \code{cards.h}
and \code{rank.h}. The translation step (\code{make all-cogent}) corresponds to the commands
\begin{verbatim}
  gencot hfile cards.h
  gencot hfile rank.h
  gencot -I. cfile cards.c
  gencot -I. unit all.unit
\end{verbatim}

Note that the function declarations in the \code{.h} files are not translated to Cogent. However, the comments specified 
there are moved to the function definitions in the translation of the \code{.c} file. This feature depends on the order of
processing the \code{.h} files before the \code{.c} file. Otherwise, the ordering of the commands is irrelevant.

\section{Multiple Source Files}
\label{struct-multi}

A larger C program often consists of several \code{.c} files. Every \code{.c} file is a separate translation unit and
must be translated by the C compiler to a seperate \code{.o} file. The \code{.o} files are then linked together to
yield the executable program binary.

To process such a program by Gencot every \code{.c} file must be processed on its own in the form
\begin{verbatim}
  gencot -I. cfile foo.c
\end{verbatim}
and yields a separate Cogent source file \code{foo.cogent}. All these translations together comprise a single
Cogent program which is compiled by the Cogent compiler in a single step and results in a single C compilation unit.

The file \code{all.unit} passed to \code{gencot unit} must now contain the names of all \code{.c} files, each in a 
separate line.

Together, the commands for translating the C program are
\begin{verbatim}
  gencot hfile foo.h
  ... <other .h files> ...
  gencot -I. cfile foo.c
  ... <other .c files> ...
  gencot -I. unit all.unit
\end{verbatim}
The generated file \code{all.cogent} includes all translations of \code{.c} files. As before, it is the 
file to be processed by the Cogent compiler.

\subsection{Example}

In the example program in \code{examples/cards2} the contents of \code{card.c} from \code{examples/cards} has been 
distributed to the three files \code{main.c}, \code{cards.c} and \code{rank.c}, which are listed in \code{all.unit}.
The translation step (\code{make all-cogent}) corresponds to the commands
\begin{verbatim}
  gencot hfile cards.h
  gencot hfile rank.h
  gencot -I. cfile cards.c
  gencot -I. cfile rank.c
  gencot -I. cfile main.c
  gencot -I. unit all.unit
\end{verbatim}
The resulting file \code{all.cogent} includes all three Cogent sources \code{cards.cogent}, \code{rank.cogent}, and
\code{main.cogent}.

The entry wrappers are now distributed in the same way to the three files \code{cards-entry.ac}, \code{rank-entry.ac},
and \code{main-entry.ac} (Not yet implemented! Provided with the example). All three must be specified now for the option
\code{--infer-c-funcs} in the Cogent compilation step (\code{make all-c}) and are included by the final C source
\code{all.c}.

\section{Partial Translation}
\label{struct-partial}

Gencot supports partially translating a C program to Cogent, if the C program consists of multiple \code{.c} source
files. In this case, some of the \code{.c} files are translated to Cogent and together yield a syntactically complete 
Cogent program. When translated back by the Cogent compiler it results in a single C compilation unit, which must be
linked with the remaining \code{.c} files to be executed.

In this way it is possible to incrementally translate a large C program to Cogent, starting with a single \code{.c} 
source and then extending it to more and more \code{.c} files until eventually all \code{.c} files have been translated.
At every intermediate step the program should still be executable after processing the translated part with the Cogent
compiler and can be tested whether it still behaves in the same way as the original C program.

To partially translate a C program, proceed as before, but put into \code{all.unit} only the names of those \code{.c}
files which shall be translated. You need only translate those \code{.h} files which are (directly or transitively)
included by the translated \code{.c} files. 

For a partially translated C program Gencot generates entry wrappers only for the translated functions, but it now
generates exit wrappers for all functions in the remaining \code{.c} files which are invoked from the translated functions.
In this way function invocations between the translated part and the remaining part are supported in both directions.
Additionally, Gencot translates all data types in a binary compatible way (not yet implemented for structs! requires Dargent 
or modification of Cogent), so that data can be passed back and forth between the translated and remaining part.

\subsection{Example}

The example program in \code{examples/cards2} can be partially translated by applying Gencot only to the files \code{main.c}
and \code{rank.c} and using the resulting Cogent program together with the original \code{cards.c}. The example provides
the file \code{part.unit} with the content
\begin{verbatim}
  rank.c
  main.c
\end{verbatim}

The partial translation step (\code{make part-cogent}) corresponds to the commands
\begin{verbatim}
  gencot hfile cards.h
  gencot hfile rank.h
  gencot -I. cfile rank.c
  gencot -I. cfile main.c
  gencot -I. unit part.unit
\end{verbatim}
The resulting file \code{part.cogent} includes only the Cogent sources \code{rank.cogent}, and
\code{main.cogent}. Note that you still have to translate \code{cards.h} because it is also included by \code{main.c}.

To execute the partially translated program, first edit the Cogent files (\code{make part-edit}) so that they contain
the following Cogent code:
\begin{verbatim}
rank.cogent:
  #include "rank-incl.cogent"

  cogent_ranking_to_string : Cogent_hand_ranking_t -> String
  cogent_ranking_to_string r =
    if r == cogent_STRAIGHT_FLUSH then "STRAIGHT_FLUSH" else
    if r == cogent_FOUR_OF_A_KIND then "FOUR_OF_A_KIND" else
    if r == cogent_FULL_HOUSE then "FULL_HOUSE" else
    if r == cogent_FLUSH then "FLUSH" else
    if r == cogent_STRAIGHT then "STRAIGHT" else
    if r == cogent_THREE_OF_A_KIND then "THREE_OF_A_KIND" else
    if r == cogent_TWO_PAIR then "TWO_PAIR" else
    if r == cogent_PAIR then "PAIR" else
    if r == cogent_NOTHING then "NOTHING" else
    "Invalid"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
main.cogent:
  #include "cards-incl.cogent"
  #include "rank-incl.cogent"

  cogent_main : () -> U32
  cogent_main () =
    cogent_puts("Just a test:");
    cogent_print_card(cogent_card_from_num(42));
    cogent_puts("  is card no 42");
    cogent_print_card(cogent_card_from_letters('Q', 'd'));
    cogent_puts("  is diamonds queen");
    0
\end{verbatim}

Then compile and postprocess the Cogent program (\code{make part-cogent-c}):
\begin{verbatim}
  cogent -o part-gen -g part.cogent \
     --cogent-pp-args="-I$GENCOT_HOME/include" \
     --infer-c-funcs="part-externs.ac main-entry.ac rank-entry.ac"
  auxcog unit part.unit
\end{verbatim}

Compile the resulting C program \code{part.c} with the C compiler to yield \code{part.o},
compile the original \code{cards.c} to yield \code{cards.o}, and link both files to the binary
\code{part-cogent-cards} (\code{make part-cogent-binary}). When executing this binary it should
behave like the original C program.

\chapter{Translation of Types}
\label{types}

Gencot is able to translate most C types to a corresponding Cogent type. In this chapter we will look at the way 
how Gencot does this.

The goal of Gencot is to translate C types to ``binary compatible'' Cogent types. This means, if the type is 
translated back to C by the Cogent compiler, it must have the same memory layout. This property is required
for partial translation (see Section~\ref{struct-partial}): it must be possible to pass values between 
translated Cogent parts and original C parts at runtime without need for conversion.

\section{Automatic Type Translation}
\label{types-auto}

For every C type Gencot has a default way how to translate it to a binary compatible Cogent type. 

\subsection{Example}
\label{types-auto-example}

To get a first impression, go to \code{examples/types}. The file \code{types.c} contains example type definitions
for several different kinds of C types. Use Gencot to translate this file, as described in Section~\ref{struct-single} 
(\code{make all-cogent}):
\begin{verbatim}
  gencot cfile types.c
  gencot unit all.unit
\end{verbatim}

Now look at the generated file \code{types.cogent}. For every C type definition in \code{types.c} it contains 
a Cogent type definition where the type expression on the right-hand side is the translation of the original C type.

\subsection{Direct Types}
\label{types-auto-direct}

A C type is called a ``direct type'', if it is primitive, or an enumeration, a struct or a unit type.

As you can see from the examples, primitive C types are directly translated to primitive Cogent types, if they are
integral types. For floating point types an error specification is generated which is not a syntactically valid 
Cogent type and will be signaled as an error by the Cogent compiler. Floating point types must be translated manually
by the developer.

Note that Gencot generates Cogent type names of the form \code{Cogent\_<name>} where \code{<name>} is the ``typedef
name'' used in C. 

Enumeration types are always translated to type \code{U32}. According to the C standard, enumeration types are always
equivalent to type \code{int}, irrespective how many values are declared for them. Gencot additionally introduces
a Cogent constant for every declared enumeration value. If the enum type has a tag, Gencot introduces an additional
type alias of the form \code{Enum\_Cogent\_<tag>}.

Structure types are translated to Cogent record types. If the struct type has a tag, Gencot introduces a type alias
of the form \code{Struct\_Cogent\_<tag>}. For an anonymous struct (without a tag), Gencot instead introduces a type alias
of the form \code{Struct<line>\_<file>} using the line number and source file name where the struct definition occurs.

Although the struct type corresponds to an unboxed record type in Cogent, the type definition defines an alias for the 
boxed record type instead. The unbox operator is applied to all \textit{references} to the type alias, as you can see 
for the fields in the record \code{Struct\_Cogent\_line}.

Union types are translated to abstract types, omitting the fields. Semantically, the corresponding Cogent types would
be variant types, however, these are not binary compatible. Therefore Gencot leaves the translation of union types to
the developer, it only generates type aliases in a similar way as for struct types.

\subsection{Derived Types}
\label{types-auto-derived}

In C there are three kinds of types called ``derived types'': function types, pointer types, and array types.

As you can see from the examples, C function types are directly translated to Cogent function types. Note that these
are not binary compatible, however, this is not a problem since in C functions cannot occur in data structures (in
contrast to function \textit{pointers}).

In Cogent every function has a single value as parameter and a single value as result. Gencot wraps multiple parameters
in a tuple and uses the unit value, if a C function has no parameter or no result value (specified as \code{void}).
A C function declared to take a variable number of parameters (a ``variadic'' function) is translated as if the 
additional parameters would always be a single value. The used pseudo type alias is not defined and will be signaled
as an error by the Cogent compiler, this must be handled manually by the developer.

The only pointer types directly supported by Cogent are boxed record types, which correspond to pointers to structs.
Accordingly, pointers to a struct type are translated to boxed record types in Cogent. The difference from the translation
of a struct type can be seen at the fields in the example \code{Struct\_Cogent\_sphere}: for the struct pointer no
unbox operator is applied. 

However, instead of an unbox operator, the generic type \code{MayNull} is applied to the referenced pointer type. In 
Cogent, a value of a boxed record type must be guaranteed to be not \code{NULL}. Since this is not the case for an 
arbitrary C pointer type, both are not strictly binary compatible. Gencot defines the generic type \code{MayNull}
and applies it to all translated C pointer types. Gencot provides an abstract data type for \code{MayNull} which allows
access to the record only after an explicit test whether the pointer is not \code{NULL}. Like the unbox operator,
Gencot does not apply \code{MayNull} in the type definition, but instead to all references of the defined type alias.

C pointer types where the base type is a primitive type, an enum type, or another pointer type, are translated with the
help of the generic type \code{CPtr}. Gencot defines a corresponding abstract type with functions to access the 
referenced value. Again, whenever such a type is used, the \code{MayNull} type is applied to it to care for \code{NULL} 
values.

C function pointers are treated in a different way by Gencot. Since there is no binary compatible Cogent type for them 
(function type values are represented by integers numbering all known functions in Cogent), Gencot translates function pointer
types to abstract Cogent types. To support a unique correspondence, the C function type expression is encoded into
the name used for the abstract Cogent type. As an exercise, you may try to find out the encoding scheme by looking
at the examples. The example defines function pointer types for all function types defined previously in the same example. 
The additional example \code{Cogent\_funHigher\_t} shows that this also works for higher order functions: as specified by the 
C standard, a parameter of function type is ``adjusted'' to function pointer type and translated accordingly by Gencot.

Translated C function pointer types are always used with an unbox operator applied. Thus they behave in the same way as 
primitive types in Cogent. This is correct, since although the values are pointers, they cannot be dereferenced in 
a Cogent program. Instead, Gencot provides functions to convert between these pointers and values of the corresponding
Cogent function type.

Cogent provides means to represent arrays, but none of them is fully binary compatible with C arrays. Therefore Gencot
translates all array types to abstract Cogent types and provides abstract functions to work with their values. Gencot
uses generic types of the form \code{CArr<size>} where the array size (number of elements) is encoded into the type name.
This works for all kinds of element types.

Depending on its use, an array in C may be represented by a pointer to the first element or by the sequence of all elements.
Accordingly, Gencot translates an array type either to the boxed abstract type (corresponding to pointer values) or it
applies the unbox operator (corresponding to the sequence of elements). In the example this can be seen in the types 
\code{Struct56\_types\_c} and \code{Cogent\_funArray\_t}: when used as a struct member, the array is used in its unboxed
form and the sequence of elements is embedded in-place; when used as a function parameter, the array type is used in 
its boxed form corresponding to a pointer, because according to the C standard the array type is ``adjusted'' to an array
pointer type.

Finally, the example shows that multidimensional arrays are translated to array-of-array. Again, the unboxed form is used
since the elements of the inner array are directly embedded in the outer array.

\subsection{Generated Abstract Types}
\label{types-auto-gen}

We have seen that Gencot uses some abstract types when it translates C ``derived types'' to Cogent. For some of them, like 
\code{MayNull} and \code{CPtr}, the Gencot distribution includes their definitions. However, other abstract types
depend on the translated C program: those used for array types and those used for function pointer types. Where
are their definitions provided?

Look at the file \code{all-dvdtypes.cogent} in \code{examples/types}. As described in Section~\ref{struct-single} it was 
generated by the command
\begin{verbatim}
  gencot unit all.unit
\end{verbatim}
It contains all abstract type definitions required for translated derived C types. Note that for every array
size used in the program a single type of the form \code{CArr<size>} is defined, even if several types of this
size with different element types are used in C. You can also see that \code{CArr<size>} is actually not abstract, 
instead the array is wrapped in a record for technical reasons.

As a convenience, for every function pointer type alias a similar alias for the corresponding function type is 
defined. This is intended to be used when converting between both.

\subsection{Continuing the Example}

To verify that the type definitions generated in Section~\ref{types-auto-example} can actually be processed by the 
Cogent compiler, you may perform the following steps:

\begin{description}
\item[Step 1:] (make all-edit)

Remove all type definitions generated from the floating point types and variadic function types 
from the files \code{types.cogent} and \code{all-dvdtypes.cogent}

\item[Step 2:] (make all-c)

Now you can process \code{all.cogent} by the Cogent compiler. Enter the command
\begin{verbatim}
  cogent -o all-gen -g all.cogent \
     --cogent-pp-args="-I$GENCOT_HOME/include" \
     --infer-c-funcs="all-externs.ac types-entry.ac"
\end{verbatim}
It creates the files \code{all-gen.c} and \code{all-gen.h} and two (empty) \code{\_pp\_inferred.c} files. 

The option \code{--cogent-pp-args} adds the directory \code{\$GENCOT\_HOME/include} to the include path
used by Cogent. It is needed to load the definitions for the types \code{MayNull} and \code{CPtr} from
the Gencot distribution. 

The corresponding include directives can be found in the file \code{gencot.cogent}
which is provided with the example. Whenever Gencot finds a file with this name in the current directory it 
includes it in the generated file \code{all.cogent}. By adding include directives to \code{gencot.cogent}
all types and functions predefined by Gencot can be made available.

As usual, enter the command
\begin{verbatim}
  auxcog unit all.unit
\end{verbatim}
for postprocessing.

\item[Step 3:] (make all-binary)

Compile \code{all.c} with a C compiler to an object file, such as in 
\begin{verbatim}
  cc -c -I`cogent --stdgum-dir` -I$GENCOT_HOME/c all.c
\end{verbatim}
This should work and produce \code{all.o}, however, it is of no much interest,
since Cogent does not translate most of our type definitions to C, because they are not used in functions.

\item[Step 4:] (make clean)

Clean up all generated files.
