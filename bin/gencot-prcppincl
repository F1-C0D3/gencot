# documentation:
# 
# An include directive has one of the forms
#   #include "filename"
#   #include MACROCALL
#   #include <filename>
# This filter processes only the first two forms, the third form (system includes) is discarded. 
# For the first form, if filename has the form file.h it is replaced by file-incl.cogent. 
# In all other cases and for the second form it is transferred without modification. 
# For all transferred directives origin markers are added.
#
# Implementation in awk:
# - After matching a normalized include directive, the file specification is field 2.
# - To test whether field 2 starts with " it is matched against the pattern /¬"/.
# - To test whether field 2 starts with < it is matched against the pattern /¬"/.
# - In all other cases the second form is assumed.
