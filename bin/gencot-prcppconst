# documentation:
# 
# A masked preprocessor constant definition has the form
#   _#define GENCOT_NNN replacement-body
# where NNN is the original constant name. Constant names in the replacement-body have already been
# mapped to Cogent constant names.
#
# The corresponding Cogent value definition has the form
#   #define NNN replacement-body
#   nam: tp
#   nam = NNN
# where nam is the result of mapping NNN to a Cogent variable name and tp is a primitive Cogent type.
#
# The input contains line directives where the main input is marked by the filename "<stdin>". Only
# constant definitions in the main input are translated. Line directives are not transferred to the output,
# instead, origin markers are generated.
# 
# Implementation in awk:
# - Function mapname maps a macro name to a Cogent variable name, always starting with a lowercase letter.
# - The array types is used to associate for every constant definition the determined type with the 
#   Cogent variable name.
# - The array vals is used to associate for every constant definition with type "String" the string
#   content with the Cogent variable name.
# - The boolean variable forgn is set to 1 while processing content from an included file. It is 
#   0 while processing content from file "<stdin>".
# - The variable lnr is used to count the current line number in file "<stdin>", respecting line
#   directives for "<stdin>".
# - Line directives are recognized by the first field being "#". Since directives are normalized, in all
#   other cases the directive keyword must be part of the first field.
# - cont is a boolean variable which tells whether the next line is a continuation line for the
#   same directive. It is set according to whether there is a backslash at the end of the previous line.
#   This is detected by matching the line with the regular expression /\\$/.
# - awk splits lines at whitespace to fields. Thus a definition line has the following fields: 
#   $1 is _#define, $2 is GENCOT_NNN, the remaining fields are the replacement-body, possibly continued 
#   in continuation lines.
# - To select the definition lines in awk the expression pattern $1 == "_#define" is used.
# - To test whether a string starts with a digit, letter, or - it must be matched with a pattern 
#   of the form $3 ~ /^.../. A single digit is matched by [0-9] or [:digit:], 
#   a single letter is matched by [A-Za-z] or [:alpha:].
# - To test for a character constant we use [\x27] instead of ' to avoid the single quote in the 
#   quoted awk program.
# - A number is complemented using the function compl(...). awk uses floating point numbers for
#   its numeric calculations which correspond to 53 bit numbers. To yield the complement
#   for 32 bit numbers the result must be masked using the bitwise and function and(...).
# - If <val> is a hexadecimal number of the form 0xABC then awk interpretes it as a string 
#   and when compared with < it uses string comparison instead of numeric comparison. 
#   In numerical calculations it is converted by using only the leading 0.
#   Hexadecimal numbers are converted to numeric with the predefined function strtonum(...).
