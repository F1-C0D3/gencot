\chapter{Introduction}

Gencot (GENerating COgent Toolset) is a set of tools for generating Cogent code from C code. It is developed by UniBw 
as part of the HoBit project conducted with Hensoldt Cyber. In the project it is used for reimplementing
the mbedTLS library in Cogent as sembedTLS. However, Gencot is not specific for mbedTLS and should be applicable
to other C code as well.

Gencot is used for parsing the C sources and generating templates for the required Cogent sources, 
antiquoted Cogent sources, and auxiliary C code. 

Gencot is not intended to perform an automatic translation, it prepares the manual translation by 
generating templates and perfoming some mechanic steps.

Roughly, Gencot supports the following tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item translate C preprocessor constant definitions and enum constants to Cogent object definitions,
\item generate function invocation entry and exit wrappers,
\item generate Cogent abstract function definitions for invoked exit wrappers,
\item translate C type definitions to default Cogent type definitions,
\item generate C type mappings for abstract Cogent types referring to existing C types,
\item generate Cogent function definition skeletons for all C function definitions,
\item rename constants, functions, and types to satisfy Cogent syntax requirements and avoid collisions,
\item convert C comments to Cogent comments and insert them at useful places in the Cogent source files,
\item generate the main files \code{<package>.cogent} and \code{<package>.ac} for Cogent compilation.
\end{itemize}

To do this, Gencot processes in the C sources most comments and preprocessor directives, all declarations (whether
on toplevel or embedded in a context), and all function definitions. It does not process C statements other than
for processing embedded declarations.

\section{General Context}

We assume that there is a C application <package> which consists of C source files \code{.c} and \code{.h}. The 
\code{.h} files are included by \code{.c} files and other \code{.h} files. There may be included \code{.h} which
are not part of <package>, such as standard C includes, all of them must be accessible. Every \code{.c} file
is a separate compilation unit. There may be a \code{main} function but Gencot provides no specific support for it.

From the C sources of <package> Gencot generates Cogent source files \code{.cogent} and antiquoted Cogent source
files \code{.ac} as a basis for a manual translation from C to Cogent. All function definition bodies have to be
translated manually, for the rest a default translation is provided by Gencot.

Gencot supports an incremental translation, where some parts of <package> are already translated to Cogent and
some parts consist of the original C implementation, together resulting in a runnable system.

\chapter{Implementation}

Gencot is implemented by a collection of unix shell scripts using the unix tools \code{sed}, \code{awk}, and the 
C preprocessor \code{cpp} and by Haskell programs using the C parser \code{language-c}. 

Every step is implemented as a Unix filter, reading from standard input and writing to standard output. A filter
may read additional files when it merges information from several steps. The filters
can be used manually or they can be combined in scripts or makefiles. Gencot provides some predefined scripts
for filter combinations.
