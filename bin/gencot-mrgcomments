# documentation:
#
# In the BEGIN rule we read the comment units into the arrays before and after. The first unit is
# stored in before, then we switch whenever we find the separator -}_ at the beginning of a line.
# The current array to be used is specified by the boolean variable bef.
# 
# All units are collected in variable unit until the separator occurs. Before-units are stored
# in the element indexed by the current line number lnr of the separator. This line number is stored
# in alnr and used as index for storing the following after-unit.
#
# The line number lnr is only counted for lines without separator, since the newline immediately before
# the separator is a part of the separator and must not be counted.
#
# Variable ustart is used to avoid inserting a newline at the start of a unit. 
 
# In the line rule we use three buffers to collect before-units, line content and after-units. The
# buffers are output as a group whenever a normal line or an #ENDORIG marker is followed by
# - an #ORIGIN marker
# - another normal line
# The variable pending is set when a normal line has been buffered. It is cleared when the buffers 
# are output.
#
# after-units are concatenated with a separating newline to end a trailing line comment. before-units
# are concatenated immediately, since they either end with a newline or have no trailing line comment.
# 
# The print statement appends a newline to the group. Therefore, in the output, a
# before-unit always starts in a new line, even if in the original source it started in the same
# line after the previous after-unit. This is intended, since the units can be reordered in the 
# target code.

# In the END rule a pending group is output.

# Implementation in awk:
# - The filename argument for the comment file must be copied and removed from the argument list ARGV
#   to prevent its processing as normal input to awk. The comment file is explicitly read by getline.
# - The presence of the separator at the beginning of a line is tested by matching each line with the 
#   pattern /^-\}_/. If present it is omitted by using substr(cline,4) which starts after the 
#   separator.
