# documentation:
# 
# The BEGIN rule reads the code to be merged in from the argument file,
# organizing it in chunks consisting of an #ORIGIN marker and all subsequent lines up to but excluding the
# next #ORIGIN marker. The chunks are stored in array content, indexed by consecutive numbers starting with 1.
# The chunk start lines according to their #ORIGIN markers are stored in array origin.
#
# An #ORIGIN marker always includes a newline before it. This is discarded when reading from cfile, hence
# it is added explicitly at the beginning of content[mrg]. The newline of the next #ORIGIN marker is
# read at the end, therefore no newline is added at the end of content[mrg] and content[mrg] is printed
# with printf which does not add a newline. Only the last content[mrg] does not get a newline from a following
# #ORIGIN marker, hence we add it explicitly after closing cfile.
#
# The line rule tests for an #ORIGIN marker in the input. If found, all chunks with a lower origin line
# are inserted before it. Again, the newline before the #ORIGIN marker belongs to it, therefore we use
# the buffer buf and the flag notfirst to defer output by one line.
#
# The variable prevEndorig is used to insert a newline before every conditional directive where this is necessary.
#
# Implementation in awk:
# - The filename argument for the directive file must be copied and removed from the argument list ARGV
#   to prevent its processing as normal input to awk. The directive file is explicitly read by getline.
# - For some reason origin[mrg] < $2 would use string comparison. The predefined function strtonum
#   forces numerical comparison.
