# documentation:
# 
# The implementation is based on a stack where each level corresponds to one transitive included file. Variable
# stackptr keeps track of the level. The original input file corresponds to level 0, every included file increases
# the level. For each level the following information is stored in arrays:
# - input: the full file pathname, either absolute or relative to the current directory of the awk process. Used
#   for reading the input with getline. For level 0 it is /dev/stdin. It is also used in the generated
#   line directives, here for level 0 <stdin> is used instead.
# - curdir: the full directory pathname of the file. Used for searching included files. For level 0 it is "-".
#   Otherwise it has a trailing "/" or is "" for the current directory of the awk process.
# - lnr: the current line number in the file. It is the number of the last line read with getline on the level.
# For level 0 also the current file name is stored in variable curname. This is usually "<stdin>" but can be
# modified by explicit line directives in the input file, to support "included" information on level 0.
#
# Implementation in awk:
# - The program consists only of a BEGIN rule, it reads all input lines and the lines of all included
#   files explicitly with getline.
# - The argument directory list is read into the array dirs, the number of directories in the list is stored in ndirs.
# - The optional list of includes to be omitted contains a pathname in every line. For every pathname read
#   the corresponding entry in the boolean array omit is set to 1.
# - For reading the standard input on level 0 with getline the pseudo pathname /dev/stdin is used which is 
#   interpreted by awk.
# - The for loop processes one file in each iteration. After each file the stack is popped by decrementing stackptr.
#   When it becomes negative the file on level 0 is finished and the program ends.
# - The while loop processes one line in the file of the current level. It processes include directives and
#   line directives, all other lines are copied to the output without modifications.
# - An include directive may be written with or without whitespace before and after the include keyword and at
#   the beginning of the line. All these possibilities are covered by the regular expression
#     /^[[:blank:]]*#[[:blank:]]*include[[:blank:]]*\"/
#   Due to the quote at the end it matches only quoted include directives, no system include directives and no
#   include directives where the included file is specified by a macro call.
#   The matched include directive is then normalized by creating the form where there is only one space after 
#   the keyword. The statement $0 = $0 is used to reprocess the input line so that the quoted file name is in 
#   field $2. The quotes are removed and the result is stored in ipath. If the array omit is set for ipath the
#   include is ignored.
# - Searching the included file is implemented by constructing the possible file name in t and trying to read 
#   from the file with getline. When this succeeds, the file has been found.
# - ipath is first searched using curdir on the current level, then the directories in dirs. If found, fpath
#   is set to the pathname used for the successful file access.
# - Multiple includes are prevented using the boolean array processed. It uses the full pathname of every included
#   file as index. Upon the first include the value is set to 1. The same mechanism is used to omit includes
#   by initializing the value for a pathname to 1.
# - The line directive for the included file is generated whenever the file has been found, even if this is
#   a repeated include.
# - Upon first include of a file, a new level is pushed onto the stack. input is the full file pathname fpath, curdir
#   is derived from fpath, and lnr is set to 0. Upon a repeated include only the final line directive is generated.
# - If a line directive is found in the input on level 0, it is used to update curnam and lnr on the current level.
#   On all other levels only lnr is updated but the filename is ignored. That implies that in included files line
#   directives may never signal switching to another input file. In all cases, line directives are copied to the
#   output without modifications.
# - After the while loop we generate the final line directive after the included file. Since the stack has not yet
#   been popped we explicitly address the next lower level by stackptr-1. At the end of the main input file on
#   level 0 no line directive is generated.
