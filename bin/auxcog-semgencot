# documentation:
#
# The generated theory has the following form:
# - the name of the input theory must be X_ShallowShared_Tuples.
#   Otherwise an error message is written to stderr.
# - the name of the output theory is X_Shallow_Gencot_Semantics.
# - the output theory imports X_ShallowConsts_Desugar_Tuples
#   and for every line 
#     gencot: id
#   in the argument file for which id is in gencot_tuples or gencot_semantics the theory 
#   Gencot_id_Tuples or Gencot_id_Semantics, respectively, and for every line
#     common: id
#   in the argument file for which id is in common_tuples or common_semantics the theory 
#   CogentCommon_id_Tuples or CogentCommon_id_Semantics, respectively.
# - the output theory contains for every type synonym definition of the form
#     type_synonym 'el CArr<size>\<^sub>T = 'el list CArr<size>
#   in the input theory a section of the following form. The <size> my be either specified by a named 
#   constant <sizeval>, or by a number literal <sizeval>. In the first case <size> has the form X<sizename>X
#   and <sizeval> is the result of mapping the C <sizename> to a Cogent name using the name prefix map.
#   In the second case <sizeval> = <sizename> = <size>.
#   The section always contains a locale interpretation of the form
#     interpretation FxdArr<size>: FxdArr arr<size>\<^sub>f CArr<size>.make <sizeame> "0::32 word"
#       by (unfold_locales, unfold CArr<size>.make_def [, auto simp add: <sizename>_def])
#   where the auto part is only present in case of a named constant, and an adhoc overloading of the form
#     adhoc_overloading 
#           arr ...
#       and carr ...
#       ...
#   for all array operations and predicates
#     arr, carr, siz, getArr, setArr, modifyArr, modrefArr, toCAES, fromCAES, rotoCAES, rofromCAES,
#     mkFxdArr, arr_update, wlsd, arrp, prsvwlsd, prsvarrp
#   If the size is a named constant, the section additionally adds the word constant definition to the simpset
#     lemmas [simp] = <sizeval>_def
#   and defines a nat constant
#     definition "<sizename> \<equiv> (unat <sizeval>)"
#   and contains the locale interpretation
#     interpretation <sizename>_Rules: NamedSizeRules <sizeval> <sizename> "(0::32 word)"
#       by(unfold_locales,simp_all add: unat_of_nat <sizename>_def)
#   After the sections, if there have been named constants for size specifications, the output theory contains 
#   two lemma collections of the form
#     lemmas sizFxdArr_defs = <sizename1>_def <sizename2>_def ...
#     lemmas to_sizFxdArr[simplified,symmetric] = <sizename1>_Rules.to_C <sizename2>_Rules.to_C ...
#   and always a lemma collection of the form
#     lemmas mkFxdArr_def = FxdArr<size1>.mkFxdArr_def FxdArr<size2>.mkFxdArr_def ...
#   and lemma collections of the form
#     lemmas <lem>FxdArr = FxdArr<size1>.<lem> FxdArr<size2>.<lem> ...
#   for all <sizei>, and all following lemmas or lemma collections <lem>:
#     wlsdRules arrpRules sem_C errsem_C transCAES transMk constMk
#
# The list of theories which can be imported is specified by the string variables 
# gencot_tuples, gencot_semantics, common_tuples, and common_semantics as a sequence of words separated by blanks.
# The list of array operations and predicates is specified in the array afuns of length nr_afuns,
# the list of array lemmas is specified in the array lems of length nr_lems.
#
# The input is read until a line of the form "theory <name>" is found. Using the <name>, 
# the output theory header is generated. The argument file is read using getline to 
# generate the corresponding imports.
# 
# Then the rest of the input is read and for each matching type synonym definition the 
# interpretation and adhoc overloading is generated and the size is stored in the array sizes,
# counting the entries in nr_sizes. If the size is specified by a named constant, the array namedsizes
# and the counter nr_namedsizes is additionally used for the <sizeval>s.
# 
# In the END rule if nr_namedsizes is not 0 the two specific lemma collections are generated. Then, if nr_sizes 
# is not 0 the other lemma collections are generated and the theory is finished by an "end".
#
# From the name prefix map only the lowercase replacements are used, since only names of constants are mapped.
# The name prefix map is stored in the arrays prefix and repl, indexed by consecutive integers starting with 1.
# repl[i] is the (lowercase) replacement of prefix[i]. The number of map entries is stored in numnpm.
#
# Implementation in awk:
# - For a named size specification function mapname maps a <sizename> to a <sizeval>, always starting with a lowercase letter.
#   It does not use regex matching since the prefixes in the name prefix map are specified literally.
#   Instead, the substring of the same length as the prefix is calculated and compared with the prefix.
#   If no prefix from the name prefix map matches the default mapping is applied by prepending "cogent_".
# - The filename argument for the comment file must be copied and removed from the argument list ARGV
#   to prevent its processing as normal input to awk. The argument file is explicitly read by getline.
# - In the BEGIN rule the name prefix map file is read. Function split is used to split each line into words.
#   Empty lines (0 words) are ignored. Lines with only one word specify a replacement for the empty prefix.
#   In other lines the first word is the prefix, the second word is the replacement, all other words are ignored.
#   The replacement is split at "|" separators using the regex "\\|". If it contains no separator its first
#   character is converted to lowercase, otherwise the second part is used.
# - The theory lists gencot_tuples, gencot_semantics, common_tuples, and common_semantics are defined in the BEGIN rule.
# - The function and lemma arrays are filled in the BEGIN rule by splitting a string of words.
# - Since in '...' the ' cannot be escaped, we avoid using it in match expressions.
# - To test whether an entry from the argument file is a member of a theory list the awk builtin function
#   match is used. The theory list is specified as the string, the entry is used as regexp. If a match
#   is found the function returns the index of the first position of the match (which is equivalent to true),
#   otherwise it returns 0 (which is equivalent to false). Note that this works only if no theory name 
#   is a substring of another theory name in the list.
# - To test whether a size specification is a literal or a named constant the regexp /^[0-9]*$/ is used.
