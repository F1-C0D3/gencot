# documentation:
# 
# A preprocessor constant definition has the form
#   #define NNN XXX
# where NNN does not contain a "(" (parameterless macro) and XXX is not empty.
# Definitions where NNN is listed in the argument file are omitted.
#
# Implementation in awk:
# - After matching a normalized directive, NNN is field 2 and XXX consists of the remaining fields.
# - To test whether field 2 contains a parenthesis it is matched against the pattern /\(/.
# - To test whether XXX is empty the number of fields NF is tested to be larger than 2.
# - Alternatively XXX may be specified in continuation lines. Then the definition line ends with a backslash
#   which is tested by matching the definition line against the pattern /\\$/. 
# - The boolean variable cont is set when the current line ends with a backslash. If it is true
#   for an input line that line is a continuation line of a constant definition and is output.
# - Line directives begin with an isolated # sign, this is tested by comparing field 1 with "#".
#   Line directives are copied to the output.
