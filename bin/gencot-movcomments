# documentation:
#
# In the BEGIN rule we read the before comment units into the array before. The first unit is
# stored in before, then we switch whenever we find the separator -}_ at the beginning of a line.
# Whether the current unit is a before unit is specified by the boolean variable bef.
# 
# All units are collected in variable unit until the separator occurs. Before-units are stored
# in the element indexed by the current line number lnr of the separator.
#
# The line number lnr is only counted for lines without separator, since the newline immediately before
# the separator is a part of the separator and must not be counted.
#
# Variable ustart is used to avoid inserting a newline at the start of a unit. 
 
# Implementation in awk:
# - The filename argument for the comment file must be copied and removed from the argument list ARGV
#   to prevent its processing as normal input to awk. The comment file is explicitly read by getline.
# - The presence of the separator at the beginning of a line is tested by matching each line with the 
#   pattern /^-\}_/. If present it is omitted by using substr(cline,4) which starts after the 
#   separator.
# - Writing to the comment files is done with a redirected print. Since the content of before
#   already consists of lines with a newline at the end we use printf to 
#   prevent appending an additional newline at the end of the comment files.
