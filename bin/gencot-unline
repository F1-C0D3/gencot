# documentation:
# 
# All content which is marked by line directives to be not from file "<stdin>" is removed.
# For content from "<stdin>" line directives are removed and expanded to the required number of empty lines.
#
# Implementation in awk:
# - Lines from "<stdin>" are counted in lnr, its value is the number of line already output.
# - A line directive may be written with arbitrary whitespace before and after the # sign.
#   Thus the regular expression
#     /^[[:blank:]]*#[[:blank:]]*[[:digit:]]+/
#   matches all line directives.
# - forgn is a boolean variable which tells whether the next line is from an included file, if it is
#   not a line directive.
# - we assume that line directives are never continued in successive lines.
