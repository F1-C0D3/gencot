The goal of this step is to translate a single C source file which is part of the translation set to Cogent.
This is done using Gencot to translate the file to Cogent with embedded partially translated C code.
Afterwards the embedded C code must be translated manually, as described in Section~\ref{app-transfunction}.

The translated file is either a \code{.c} file which can be seperately compiled by the C compiler as a compilation unit,
or it is a \code{.h} file which is a part of one or more compilation units by being included by other files. In both cases
the file can include \code{.h} files, both in the package and standard C include files such as \code{stdio.h}.

To be translated by Gencot the C source file must first be prepared for being read by Gencot as described in
Section~\ref{app-prep}. Then the parameter modification descriptions for all functions and function types defined 
in the source file must be created and evaluated as described in Section~\ref{app-parmod-defined}. 

\subsection{Translating Normal C Sources}
\label{app-transauto-normal}

A \code{.c} file is translated using the command
\begin{verbatim}
  gencot [options] cfile file.c [<parmod>]
\end{verbatim}
where \code{file.c} is the file to be translated and \code{<parmod>} is the file containing the parameter modification 
descriptions. If it is not provided, Gencot assumes for all functions and function types, that linear parameters 
may be modified. The result of the translation is stored as \code{file.cogent} in the current directory.

An \code{.h} file is translated using the command
\begin{verbatim}
  gencot [options] hfile file.h [<parmod>]
\end{verbatim}
where \code{file.h} is the file to be translated and \code{<parmod>} is as above. The result of the translation is 
stored as \code{file-incl.cogent} in the current directory.

\subsection{Translating Configuration Files}
\label{app-transauto-config}

Special support is provided for translating configuration files. A configuration file is a \code{.h} file mainly
containing preprocessor directives for defining flags and macros, some of which are deactivated by being ``commented
out'', i.e., they are preceded by \code{//}. If such a file is translated using the command
\begin{verbatim}
  gencot [options] config file.h [<parmod>]
\end{verbatim}
it is translated like a normal \code{.h} file, but before, all \code{//} comment starts at line beginnings are 
removed, and afterwards the corresponding Cogent comment starts \code{-\relax-} are re-inserted before the definitions.
